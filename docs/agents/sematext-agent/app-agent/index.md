title: App Agent
description: App Agent is used for collecting application metrics from JMX, REST APIs, and from databases that support JDBC

The App Agent is open-source, written in Java (but not limited to
monitoring Java!), with a number of built-in integrations available
from the
[sematext-agent-integrations](https://github.com/sematext/sematext-agent-integrations)
repo. You can add your own integrations for monitoring additional
infrastructure and services.  Pull requests welcome!

## Capabilities

The agent communicates with Sematext via HTTPS.  It buffers data on
disk in case it cannot immediately ship it, ensuring data is never
lost.

### Application monitoring

Lightweight and pluggable, this agent comes with a number of out of
the box integrations. It has built-in support for collecting metrics
from JMX, REST APIs, and from databases that support JDBC.

## App Agent Run modes

### Embedded

The [Embedded](/docs/agents/sematext-agent/app-agent/spm-monitor-javaagent) mode can be used only for
monitoring JVM-based applications since it runs as a Java Agent
inside the Java process.  With the Embedded monitor, when setting it
up for the first time or when upgrading the monitor, one needs to
change the command-line and restart the process in which the monitor
is running (i.e., the process of the application being monitored), but
once that is done, the monitor runs seamlessly in-process. See [Embedded
Mode](/docs/agents/sematext-agent/app-agent/spm-monitor-javaagent) for more info.

### Standalone

In the [Standalone](/docs/agents/sematext-agent/app-agent/spm-monitor-standalone) mode the agent runs in a
separate process and can thus be used for monitoring both Java and
non-JVM-based applications. If access to JMX is required and the
application to monitor does not have JMX enabled, one will have to
adjust application's command-line parameters to enable JMX and that
will require application process restart.  However, once that is set
up, subsequent agent updates will not require the application
restart. See [Standalone Mode](/docs/agents/sematext-agent/app-agent/spm-monitor-standalone) for
more info.

## Requirements

Java 6 and above.
