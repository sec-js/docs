title: Sematext Agents Events

Agent events are automatically collected or generated by Sematext Agent and then sent to Sematext Cloud. Below, you can find a list of all the events sent from Sematext Agent. Be sure to learn more about [how events work in Sematext](https://sematext.com/docs/events/), [how they can be viewed in Sematext Cloud](https://sematext.com/docs/events/timeline/), and [how they can be correlated with other data](https://sematext.com/docs/events/correlation/) for fast issue troubleshooting.

## Container events

### Docker events

Sematext Agent collects all events from various docker object types, including containers, images, plugins, volumes, networks, daemons, services, nodes, secrets and configs. Learn more about all the available docker events at: https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/system/events/.

All docker events sent by the Sematext Agent include the [Docker Events Tags](https://sematext.com/docs/tags/common-schema/#docker-event-tags) as defined in Sematext Common Schema.

All docker events start with `Docker Event: ` in the message field. `container.status` tag gives the docker status of the event, e.g `exec_start`, `exec_create`, `exec_died`.

Here's the list of Docker container events Sematext collects:

#### Docker lifecycle events

- Create – when a container is created
- Start – when a container starts
- Restart – when a container gets restarted
- Stop – when a container stops
- Oom – when a container runs out of memory
- Pause – when a container gets paused
- Unpause – when a container continues to run after a pause
- Die – when the main process in a container dies
- Kill – when the container gets killed
- Destroy – when a container gets destroyed

#### Docker runtime events

- Commit – when changes to the container filesystem are committed. Modifying deployed containers in production is not a common practice, therefore the commit could - indicate a “hack” and should be watched carefully.
- Copy – when files are copied from/to a container. Could indicate a potential data leak.
- Attach – when a process connects to container console – somebody is reading your container logs
- Detach – when a process disconnects from container console streams
- Exec – when a command is executed in container console, very helpful to investigate in potential hacker attacks
- Export – when a container gets exported
- Health_status – when health_status is checked
- Rename – when a container gets renamed
- Resize – when a container gets resized
- Top – when somebody list top processes in a container
- Update – when a container is updated e.g. with new labels

#### Docker image events

- Delete – when an image gets deleted
- Import – when an image gets imported
- Load – when an image is loaded
- Pull – when an image is pulled from a registry
- Push – when an image is pushed to a registry
- Save – when an image is saved
- Tag – when an image is tagged with labels
- Untag – when an image tag is removed

#### Docker plugin events

- Enable – when a plugin gets enabled
- Disable – when a plugin gets disabled
- Install – when a plugin gets installed
- Remove – when a plugin gets removed

#### Docker volume events

- Create – when a volume is created
- Destroy – when a volume gets destroyed
- Mount – when a volume is mounted to a container
- Unmount – when a volume is removed from a container

#### Docker network events

- Create – when a  network is created
- Connect – when a container connects to a network
- Remove – when the network is removed
- Destroy – when a network is destroyed
- Disconnect – when a container disconnects from a network

#### Docker daemon events

- Reload

#### Docker services, nodes, secrets, and config events

- Create – on the creation of a resource
- Remove – on the removal of a resource
- Update – on the creation of a resource

## Kubernetes events

Kubernetes events from all Kubernetes objects are supported, including: Nodes, Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, ReplicaSets, ConfigMaps, Services, Persistent volumes and more.

All Kubernetes events sent by the Sematext Agent include the [Kubernetes Events Tags](https://sematext.com/docs/tags/common-schema/#kubernetes-event-tags) as defined in Sematext Common Schema.

You can get a list of all Kubernetes events supported in your cluster by executing the following command:

```
kubectl get events
```

or to list all the events in a specified namespace, execute the command:

```
kubectl get events -n <namespace>
```

For additional information on configuring Kubernetes events, please refer to [Kubernetes event configuration](https://sematext.com/docs/agents/sematext-agent/kubernetes/events/) page.
