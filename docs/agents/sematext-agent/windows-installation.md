title: Installing Sematext Agent on Windows

Sematext Agent collects a plethora of metrics about Windows hosts (CPU, memory, disk, network, processes) as well as [Windows Events](../../integration/windows/#logs). The installer is responsible for installing the Sematext Agent, configuring it, and starting it as a Windows Service.

Installation can be done either by using the GUI installer or through the command line.

## Preconditions

Before starting, please check the [platform support policy](https://sematext.com/docs/agents/sematext-agent/platform-support-policy/) page to make sure your Windows platform is supported.

To see your Windows host metrics in Sematext Cloud, you need to [create an Infra App](https://sematext.com/docs/monitoring/infrastructure/#create-an-infra-app) and select the Windows environment. This will provide you with an Infra App token, which is essential for establishing a secure link between Sematext Cloud and Sematext Agent.

## Install from GUI

1. Download the [Sematext Agent installer](https://pub-repo.sematext.com/windows/pool/main/s/sematext-agent/sematext-agent-latest.msi)
2. Follow the installation steps and accept the license agreement 
3. Set the Infra App token
4. Select a region (EU or US) based on where you created your account in Sematext Cloud
5. Set the Logs App token
   - This is optional. If you want to ship your Windows Logs, set your Logs App token. You can find this token under your Windows Logs App's Agent Installation page. If left blank, Windows Logs collection won't be activated.

After completing these steps, Sematext Agent will be automatically started as a Windows Service.

## Install from command line

Download the [Sematext Agent installer](https://pub-repo.sematext.com/windows/pool/main/s/sematext-agent/sematext-agent-latest.msi).

### Using PowerShell

Run the following command as Administrator from the folder where you downloaded the installer:

```
Start-Process -Wait msiexec -ArgumentList "/qn /i $($msiFileName = 'AGENT_MSI_INSTALLER'; $msiFileName) /L*V `"$msiFileName.log`" INFRA_APP_TOKEN=YOUR_INFRA_APP_TOKEN REGION=YOUR_REGION_EU_or_US"
```

If you want to ship your Windows logs, be sure to also set your Logs App token. You can find this token on your Windows Logs App's Agent Installation page.

```
Start-Process -Wait msiexec -ArgumentList "/qn /i $($msiFileName = 'sematext-agent-latest.msi'; $msiFileName) /L*V `"$msiFileName.log`" INFRA_TOKEN=YOUR_INFRA_APP_TOKEN REGION=YOUR_REGION_EU_or_US LOGS_TOKEN=YOUR_LOGS_APP_TOKEN"
```

Where:

- `YOUR_INFRA_APP_TOKEN`: the Infra App token
- `YOUR_LOGS_APP_TOKEN`: the Logs App token
- `YOUR_REGION_EU_or_US`: your Sematext Cloud region - EU or US
- `AGENT_MSI_INSTALLER`: the filename of the Sematext Agent Windows installer

For example:

```
Start-Process -Wait msiexec -ArgumentList "/qn /i $($msiFileName = 'sematext-agent-latest.msi'; $msiFileName) /L*V `"$msiFileName.log`" INFRA_APP_TOKEN=7511db7f-c060-4e10-b667-5f2653d4933e REGION=EU LOGS_TOKEN=7611db7f-c060-4e10-b667-5f2653d4966b"
```

### Using Windows CMD:

Run the following command as Administrator from the folder where you downloaded the installer:

```
start /wait msiexec /qn /i "AGENT_MSI_INSTALLER" /L*V "AGENT_MSI_INSTALLER.log" INFRA_TOKEN=YOUR_INFRA_APP_TOKEN REGION=YOUR_REGION_EU_or_US
```

If you want to ship your Windows logs, be sure to also set your Logs App token. You can find this token on your Windows Logs App's Agent Installation page.

```
start /wait msiexec /qn /i "AGENT_MSI_INSTALLER" /L*V "AGENT_MSI_INSTALLER.log" INFRA_TOKEN=YOUR_INFRA_APP_TOKEN REGION=YOUR_REGION_EU_or_US LOGS_TOKEN=YOUR_LOGS_APP_TOKEN
```

Where:

- `YOUR_INFRA_APP_TOKEN`: the Infra App token
- `YOUR_LOGS_APP_TOKEN`: the Logs App token
- `YOUR_REGION_EU_or_US`: your Sematext Cloud region - EU or US
- `AGENT_MSI_INSTALLER`: the filename of the Sematext Agent Windows installer

For example:

```
start /wait msiexec /qn /i "sematext-agent-latest.msi" /L*V "sematext-agent-latest.msi.log" INFRA_APP_TOKEN=7511db7f-c060-4e10-b667-5f2653d4933e REGION=EU LOGS_TOKEN=7611db7f-c060-4e10-b667-5f2653d4966b
```

After completing these steps, Sematext Agent will be automatically started as a Windows Service.

## Deploying using Group Policy

These steps will walk you through deploying the Sematext Agent using Group Policy on a Windows Server environment. It covers both server and client-side configurations and includes steps for creating a new security group for targeted deployment. Deploying software via Group Policy allows for automated, consistent, and scalable deployments across multiple machines, ensuring that all systems are up-to-date with the latest version of Sematext Agent.

### Server-Side configuration

#### 1. Create a new security group

##### 1.a. Open Active Directory Users and Computers
- Open the **Active Directory Users and Computers** console on your server.

##### 1.b. Create a new group
- Under the domain, right-click on the **Computers**, select **New** > **Group**.
- Name the group (e.g., `SematextAgentDeployment`).
- Make sure the **Group scope** is set to **Global** and **Group type** is set to **Security**.

  ![Sematext Agent service](images/windows-agent-group-properties.png)

##### 1.c. Add computers to the group
- Right-click the newly created group, select **Properties**.
- Go to the **Members** tab and click **Add**.
- Enter the names of the computers you want to deploy the Sematext Agent. Click **Check Names** to validate they are recognized by Active Directory, then click **OK**.

#### 2. Prepare the Sematext Agent installer
- Download the [Sematext Agent installer](https://pub-repo.sematext.com/windows/pool/main/s/sematext-agent/sematext-agent-latest.msi).
- Create a PowerShell script that will be used to run the MSI installer and save it with a .ps1 extension, for example, install_sematext_agent.ps1:

```
  Start-Process -Wait msiexec -ArgumentList "/qn /i $($msiFileName = 'sematext-agent-latest.msi'; $msiFileName) /L*V `"$msiFileName.log`" INFRA_APP_TOKEN=7511db7f-c060-4e10-b667-5f2653d4933e REGION=EU"
```

  Make sure to update `INFRA_APP_TOKEN` with your Infra App token and `REGION` with `US` or `EU` depending on your Sematext Cloud region. Also validate that the file name of the MSI installer is correct.

  If you want to ship your Windows logs, be sure to also set your Logs App token.

  ```
  Start-Process -Wait msiexec -ArgumentList "/qn /i $($msiFileName = 'sematext-agent-latest.msi'; $msiFileName) /L*V `"$msiFileName.log`" INFRA_APP_TOKEN=7511db7f-c060-4e10-b667-5f2653d4933e REGION=EU LOGS_TOKEN=7611db7f-c060-4e10-b667-5f2653d4966b"
```

#### 3. Create a shared network folder
- Create a shared folder on your server, for example, `\\ServerName\Sematext_Distribution`.
- Place both install_agent.ps1 and sematext-agent-latest.msi into this shared folder.
- Set permissions on the shared folder and add the group `SematextAgentDeployment` so that all computers in the network have read access.

  ![Sematext Agent service](images/windows-agent-shared-folder.png)

#### 4. Create a new Group Policy Object (GPO)
- On your server, open the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**. You can do this by typing `gpmc.msc` in the Run dialog (Win + R).
- In the Group Policy Management Console, right-click on the domain where your client computers reside and select **Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it hereâ€¦**.
- Name the GPO something descriptive like `Deploy Sematext Agent`.

  ![Sematext Agent service](images/windows-agent-create-gpo.png)

#### 5. Scope the GPO to the group
- Select the newly created GPO in the tree.
- Under the **Security Filtering** section, click **Add**.
- Enter the name of the group you created (e.g., `SematextAgentDeployment`), click **Check Names**, and then click **OK**.

  ![Sematext Agent service](images/windows-agent-new-gpo.png)

#### 6. Configure the GPO to run the script
- Right-click the newly created GPO and select **Edit**.
- In the Group Policy Management Editor, navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Windows Settings** > **Scripts (Startup/Shutdown)**.
- Double-click on Startup, select the **PowerShell Scripts** tab and then click **Add...**.
- In the Add a Script dialog, click **Browse...** and navigate to the shared folder and select `install_sematext_agent.ps1`.

  ![Sematext Agent service](images/windows-agent-ps-script.png)

#### 7. Verify that PowerShell execution policy is set
Make sure the PowerShell execution policy on target machines allows the script to run:

- In the Group Policy Management Editor, navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Windows PowerShell**.

  ![Sematext Agent service](images/windows-agent-ps-policy.png)
  
- Enable the policy **Turn on Script Execution** and set it to **Allow all scripts**.

  ![Sematext Agent service](images/windows-agent-ps-policy-settings.png)

### Client-Side configuration

#### 1. Client machine requirements
- Confirm all client machines are joined to the domain and are members of the group you created.
- Verify client machines have network access to the shared folder containing the installer files.

#### 2. Force Group Policy update
- On a client machine, open Command Prompt with administrative privileges.
- Run the following command to force a Group Policy update:

  ```shell
  gpupdate /force
  ```

#### 3. Verify installation
- After the Group Policy update, restart the client machine.
- Log in and verify that the Sematext Agent has been installed and started as a Windows Service.

### Troubleshooting tips

1. **Check Network Access**
   - Verify the client machines can access the shared folder by browsing to the network path (e.g., `\\ServerName\Sematext_Distribution`) from a client machine.

2. **Review Event Logs**
   - On the client machine, check the Event Viewer under **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **GroupPolicy** for any errors related to software installation.

3. **Check GPO Application**
   - Confirm the GPO is correctly applied to the client machine by running `gpresult /r` in the Command Prompt on the client machine.

4. **Review GPO Settings**
   - Validate the GPO settings in the Group Policy Management Editor to verify the deployment is configured correctly.
