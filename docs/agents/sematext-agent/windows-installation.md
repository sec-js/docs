title: Installing Sematext Agent on Windows

Sematext Agent collects a plethora of metrics about Windows hosts (CPU, memory, disk, network, processes). The installer is responsible for installing the Sematext Agent, configuring it, and starting it as a Windows Service.

Installation can be done either by using the GUI installer or through the command line.

## Preconditions

Before starting, please check the [platform support policy](https://sematext.com/docs/agents/sematext-agent/platform-support-policy/) page to make sure your Windows platform is supported.

To see your Windows host metrics in Sematext Cloud, you need to [create an Infra App](https://sematext.com/docs/monitoring/infrastructure/#create-an-infra-app) and select the Windows environment. This will provide you with an Infra App token, which is essential for establishing a secure link between Sematext Cloud and Sematext Agent.

## Install from GUI

1. Download the [Sematext Agent installer](https://pub-repo.sematext.com/windows/pool/main/s/sematext-agent/sematext-agent-latest.msi)
2. Follow the installation steps and accept the license agreement 
3. Set the Infra App token
4. Select a region (EU or US) based on where you created your account in Sematext Cloud

After completing these steps, Sematext Agent will be automatically started as a Windows Service.

## Install from command line

Download the [Sematext Agent installer](https://pub-repo.sematext.com/windows/pool/main/s/sematext-agent/sematext-agent-latest.msi).

### Using PowerShell

Run the following command as Administrator from the folder where you downloaded the installer:

```
Start-Process -Wait msiexec -ArgumentList "/qn /i $($msiFileName = 'AGENT_MSI_INSTALLER'; $msiFileName) /L*V `"$msiFileName.log`" INFRA_APP_TOKEN=YOUR_INFRA_TOKEN REGION=YOUR_REGION_EU_or_US"
```

Where:

- `YOUR_INFRA_APP_TOKEN`: the Infra App token
- `YOUR_REGION_EU_or_US`: your Sematext Cloud region - EU or US
- `AGENT_MSI_INSTALLER`: the filename of the Sematext Agent Windows installer

For example:

```
Start-Process -Wait msiexec -ArgumentList "/qn /i $($msiFileName = 'sematext-agent-latest.msi'; $msiFileName) /L*V `"$msiFileName.log`" INFRA_APP_TOKEN=7511db7f-c060-4e10-b667-5f2653d4933e REGION=EU"
```

### Using Windows CMD:

Run the following command as Administrator from the folder where you downloaded the installer:

```
start /wait msiexec /qn /i "AGENT_MSI_INSTALLER" /L*V "AGENT_MSI_INSTALLER.log" INFRA_TOKEN=YOUR_INFRA_APP_TOKEN REGION=YOUR_REGION_EU_or_US
```

Where:

- `YOUR_INFRA_APP_TOKEN`: the Infra App token
- `YOUR_REGION_EU_or_US`: your Sematext Cloud region - EU or US
- `AGENT_MSI_INSTALLER`: the filename of the Sematext Agent Windows installer

For example:

```
start /wait msiexec /qn /i "sematext-agent-latest.msi" /L*V "sematext-agent-latest.msi.log" INFRA_APP_TOKEN=7511db7f-c060-4e10-b667-5f2653d4933e REGION=EU
```

After completing these steps, Sematext Agent will be automatically started as a Windows Service.

## Deploying using Group Policy

These steps will walk you through deploying the Sematext Agent using Group Policy on a Windows Server environment. It covers both server and client-side configurations and includes steps for creating a new security group for targeted deployment. Deploying software via Group Policy allows for automated, consistent, and scalable deployments across multiple machines, ensuring that all systems are up-to-date with the latest version of Sematext Agent.

Note: These instructions have been tested only on Windows Server 2022. Other Windows Server versions may also be supported but have not been verified.

### Server-Side Configuration

#### 1. Create a New Security Group

##### Open Active Directory Users and Computers
- Open the **Active Directory Users and Computers** console on your server.

##### Create a New Group
- Under the domain, right-click on the **Computers**, select **New** > **Group**.
- Name the group (e.g., `SematextAgentDeployment`).
- Make sure the **Group scope** is set to **Global** and **Group type** is set to **Security**.

##### Add Computers to the Group
- Right-click the newly created group, select **Properties**.
- Go to the **Members** tab and click **Add**.
- Enter the names of the computers you want to deploy the MSI file to. Click **Check Names** to validate they are recognized by Active Directory, then click **OK**.

#### 2. Create a Shared Network Folder
- Create a shared folder on your server, for example, `\\ServerName\Sematext_Distribution`.
- Copy the `sematext-agent-latest.msi` file into this shared folder.
- Set permissions on the shared folder and add the group `SematextAgentDeployment` so that all computers in the network have read access.

#### 3. Open Group Policy Management
- On your server, open the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**. You can do this by typing `gpmc.msc` in the Run dialog (Win + R).

#### 4. Create a New Group Policy Object (GPO)
- In the Group Policy Management Console, right-click on the domain where your client computers reside and select **Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it hereâ€¦**.
- Name the GPO something descriptive like `Deploy Sematext Agent`.

#### 5. Scope the GPO to the Group
- Select the newly created GPO in the tree.
- Under the **Security Filtering** section, click **Add**.
- Enter the name of the group you created (e.g., `SematextAgentDeployment`), click **Check Names**, and then click **OK**.

#### 6. Edit the GPO
- Right-click the newly created GPO and select **Edit**.
- In the Group Policy Management Editor, navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Software Settings** > **Software Installation**.

#### 7. Deploy the MSI File
- Right-click **Software Installation**, select **New** > **Package**.
- In the **Open** dialog, enter the network path to the `sematext-agent-latest.msi` file (e.g., `\\ServerName\Sematext_Distribution\sematext-agent-latest.msi`) and click **Open**.
- Select the **Assigned** deployment method and click **OK**.

### Client-Side Configuration

#### 1. Client Machine Requirements
- Confirm all client machines are joined to the domain and are members of the group you created.
- Verify client machines have network access to the shared folder containing the MSI file.

#### 2. Force Group Policy Update
- On a client machine, open Command Prompt with administrative privileges.
- Run the following command to force a Group Policy update:

  ```shell
  gpupdate /force
  ```

#### 3. Verify Installation
- After the Group Policy update, restart the client machine.
- Log in and verify that the Sematext Agent has been installed and started as a Windows Service.

### Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Check Network Access**
   - Verify the client machines can access the shared folder by browsing to the network path (e.g., `\\ServerName\Sematext_Distribution`) from a client machine.

2. **Review Event Logs**
   - On the client machine, check the Event Viewer under **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **GroupPolicy** for any errors related to software installation.

3. **Check GPO Application**
   - Confirm the GPO is correctly applied to the client machine by running `gpresult /r` in the Command Prompt on the client machine.

4. **Review GPO Settings**
   - Validate the GPO settings in the Group Policy Management Editor to verify the MSI deployment is configured correctly.

```

## How to check Sematext Agent logs

Sematext Agent logs are located in the `C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\sematext-agent` folder.

For example, you can access the logs file like below;

```
cd C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\sematext-agent

notepad.exe .\logs\st-agent.log
```

## How to change Infra App token or region

You can either reinstall Sematext Agent through GUI or by running the following command from command line:

```
cd  'C:\Program Files\Sematext Agent\'
.\st-agent-amd64.exe windows-config set-token -t "YOUR_INFRA_TOKEN"
.\st-agent-amd64.exe windows-config set-region -r "YOUR_REGION_EU_or_US"
```

After the changes, you need to restart the agent:

```
.\st-agent-amd64.exe windows-service restart
```

## How to unistall Sematext Agent

You can uninstall Sematext Agent using the GUI installer or from Windows Settings > Apps.

## Limitations / Known Issues

The Sematext Agent for Windows is still a work in progress and has some limitations:

- Discovery and configuration of services and log sources are not yet supported
- Inventory functionality is not yet available
- Custom tags cannot be created
- Sematext Agent for Windows is in Beta.  
  You may see the "Unknown Publisher" warning while installing the agent on your Windows host.
