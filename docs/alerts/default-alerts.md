title: Default Alerts
description: Each new App comes with its own set of alerts

When you create a new App, not only do you get a set of pre-built reports that display various metrics, logs, and other data in a well thought-out fashion, but you also get one or more "default alert rules" that are created for you automatically.

It is important to note that, just like the out-of-the-box reports are specific to what is being monitored, these default alert rules are also very **specific to the integration**.  Thus, as soon as you set things up you will benefit from these alert rules that, like the pre-build reports, you didn't have to manually configure yourself.  All default alerts can, of course, be modified, temporarily disabled, or permanently deleted.

The names of all default rules start with `Automatic - `.  For example, here's a set of alert rules that gets created with a new Elasticsearch monitoring App:

Default alert rules are created for [Monitoring](/docs/monitoring), [Logs](/docs/logs), [Experience](/docs/experience) Apps, and for [Synthetics](/docs/synthetics) Monitors.
