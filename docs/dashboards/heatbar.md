Heatbar is a single-line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map" target="_blank" title="Opens a new tab">heatmap</a> that is shown above the main, time-series chart.  
You can style any series as a heatbar, but it's especially suitable for events and logs.  

Here you can see a time-series chart which shows the total number of logs and, above it, a heatbar which tracks only errors among them.

![Heatbars example](/docs/images/dashboards/heatbar-1-example-usage-logs-with-errors.png)

A chart can have multiple series configured as heatbars, like in the following example:

![More than one Heatbar](/docs/images/dashboards/heatbar-1.1-more-than-one-hb-series.png)

If all of the series are heatbars the main time-series chart is not even shown.  
For example, the following chart is configured to show a single heatbar series, `CPU User` grouped by `OS Host`:

![Just heatbars](/docs/images/dashboards/heatbar-1.2-only-cpu-user-by-host.png)

The chart shows six heatbars because the `CPU User` metric was reported by six different `OS Hosts` during the observed time range.

### Creating Heatbars

Let's build the usage logs with errors component together.  

Since the total number of logs is not particularly interesting, we'll monitor a certain subset of logs, for example logs which contain the word `Usage`.  
We'll have our time-series chart tracking all *Usage* logs and additionally, we'll use a heatbar to track only errors, like we've seen in the first Heatbar example above.  

In your dashboard, click on the `Add component` button on the top of the screen, which looks like this:

![Add component](/docs/images/dashboards/heatbar-2-add-component.png)

In the first dialog choose `Time Series Chart`:

![Time-series chart](/docs/images/dashboards/heatbar-2.1-time-series-chart.png)

Then choose `Logs` data series:

![Logs data series](/docs/images/dashboards/heatbar-2.2-logs-data-series.png)

If you're creating your first chart, the initial result may look intimidating at first glance:

![New chart](/docs/images/dashboards/heatbar-3-empty-ts-chart_2.png)

It's just a matter of choosing what we want our chart to show. So far we've chosen a type of chart, but haven't specified which **App** to use as the source of data and which **metric** from that App to show.  

In the `App` field, choose any *Logs App* that contains data and in the `Metric` field choose a special function `count()`, which represents the number of logs.
We'll name this data series `Usage logs`, so type that into the `Label` field.

Great, errors are gone and we already see data in our chart preview:

![Chart shows data](/docs/images/dashboards/heatbar-4-count-in-ts-chart_2.png)

Let's keep things organized, change the `Custom chart` title in the upper left corner to `Usage`. You just need to click on the title to edit it in-place.  

Next, in the `Filter by` section, shown below, we are going to add a filter to our data series by typing `Usage` into the `Query` field. When you're done typing, you can apply the change with the Enter key (while the cursor is still in the `Query` field) and the chart will be updated, now containing only those logs which matched the query.

![Enter query](/docs/images/dashboards/heatbar-5-enter-query_2.png)

So far so good, we can see our `Usage logs` in the chart preview.

Now let's add a heatbar.  
Duplicate `Usage logs` series using the series action menu (`...`), like this:

![Duplicate Usage logs DS](/docs/images/dashboards/heatbar-6-clone_2.png)

Change the label of the new series to `Errors`.  

Expand the `Filter by` section, under the `Label`. As you can see in the screenshot below and hopefully in your own chart, our `query: Usage` is still here, duplicated correctly from the first series. We'll additionally filter logs to only those with `severity: error`:

![Filter to error severity](/docs/images/dashboards/heatbar-7-severity-error_2.png)

Finally, switch to the `Style` section of our second data series in the upper right corner and change its type to `heatbar` and color to red.

![Changing data series type](/docs/images/dashboards/heatbar-8-ds-style-type-and-color_2.png)

And just like that, we have our *Usage chart* with a heatbar of *Usage errors*.

### Accessing data in Heatbars

Clicking on a heatbar square opens a panel with a list of *Usage errors* from the corresponding time range.
