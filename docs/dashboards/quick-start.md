title: Sematext Dashboards Quick Start
description: Sematext Cloud Dashboards for monitoring metrics, logs, APIs, websites, etc.

Any type of component can be easily added to one or more Dashboard reports.

Once you have a dashboard created, you can start adding components to it. However, at least one or more Apps need to be created. As soon as your data is consumed and indexed by Sematext Cloud, logs, metrics, experience, events, and infrastructure components will become available to add to Dashboards. 

In the example below, we demonstrate the process of adding components from different solutions, selecting the preferred App to fetch data for each component, adding them to the Dashboard, and organizing the layout for improved visualization.

With the custom reports features you can first create specific logging, events or metric component, and add it to your Dashboard just as you can with out-of-the-box [integration](/docs/integration/) specific components that come included when you first create an App.

The image below displays a sample of a customized Infrastructure component designed to automatically retrieve top data based on CPU, Disk, and Memory usage. To add this component, navigate to the 'Infrastructure' tab on the left and select the 'Top N Hosts' option.

## Custom Components

In the 'Other' tab within the left panel for component selection, you'll find a range of generic components. Once you select a component from this category, you'll begin by choosing the solution type from which you wish to retrieve data. Next, you'll complete the necessary and optional parameters to start building your custom component. The [Chart Builder](/docs/dashboards/chart-builder/) section explains the common functionalities offered in all the components. To explore all the component types and learn how to create each one, refer to the [Components Overview](/docs/dashboards/components-overview).
