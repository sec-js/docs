title: Correlating Events with Performance Metrics and Logs
description: Split Screen is product-wide correlation and data-pivoting feature. With Split Screen you can compare Events report with any other report or dashboard, even with Events report but with different filters in the two different screens

Events can be correlated with other data in Sematext using our [Split Screen](/docs/guide/split-screen) feature. When you send meaningful events to Sematext, this sort of correlation aids and speeds up troubleshooting.

## Correlation with Metrics, Logs, User Experience, and Synthetic Monitors.
With [Split Screen](/docs/guide/split-screen) you can compare and correlate events with any [Monitoring](/docs/monitoring/), [Logs](/docs/logs/), [Infrastructure](/docs/monitoring/infrastructure/) or [Experience](/docs/experience/) report. Correlation is also possible with [Synthetic Monitors](/docs/synthetics/). It can be used to correlate even with Events report but with different filters in the two different screens.

## Event-Event Correlation
Correlation of one type of events with another type of events can also be done.  Simply select events from within [Split Screen](/docs/guide/split-screen) and apply two different filters and/or queries to select different sets of events on left and right side of the split screen.

Once you select a report you want to correlate with, itâ€™ll be remembered so you can quickly toggle it.
