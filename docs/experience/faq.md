## General

### What should I do if I can't find the answer to my question in this FAQ?

Check the [general FAQ](/docs/faq) for questions that are not strictly
about Sematext Experience.  If you can't find the answer to your
question please email <support@sematext.com> or use our live chat.


### Can I receive more data than my monthly plan limit allows?

No, not by default. In order to prevent overage and additional costs, we enable
<a href="#what-is-staggering">staggering</a> by default for all Experience
Apps. You can enable or disable this setting in your App settings -> Usage
screen.

### What is staggering?

When staggering is enabled, your App will have a maximum daily limit of page
loads based on your monthly plan limit. So if you have a plan limit of 100,000
page loads and the current month has 30 days, then your App will have a daily
limit of 3,333 page loads.

### What is overage?

By default overage is not possible since <a href="#what-is-staggering">staggering</a> 
is enabled for all new Experience Apps.

When <a href="#what-is-staggering">staggering</a> is disabled, your App may
receive more data than defined in the monthly plan limit. This additional
amount of data is called overage. Overage is charged in addition to your
monthly pricing plan cost at the end of the month.

The amount you will be charged depends on the amount of overage on a monthly
basis. If you have received 10% more data during the month than defined in your
pricing plan, then you will be charged 10% more. Again, note that overage is
not possible when you have <a href="#what-is-staggering">staggering</a>
enabled.

### When should I use sampling?

Sampling can be useful when you receive more page views than your selection in Sematext allows.
Enabling sampling means not every single page view will be recorded, but if sampling is not too
aggressive you frontend's general performance measurements should remain visible and accurate 
enough for you to be able to get insight in general performance trends, slow loading pages and
resources, etc.

### Does the Experience script have any effect on my website performance?

No, the Experience script will not negatively impact your website performance.
We will do our best to ensure that the script is as minimal as possible and
that it never interferes with the normal operation of your website or webapp.
The script is loaded asynchronously and in most cases should have no or very
small effect on website performance.

### Is the Experience script open-source?

Yes, the Experience script is open-source. Look at the [Browser SDK](/docs/agents/browser/)
to learn more. 

### Can I send data from a different domain?

Depending on your plan, you may be able to send data from multiple domains at
the same time. If your pricing plan supports more than one domain, just set up
the script on additional domains and your data should appear shortly in
Experience.

If you want to switch the domain from which you are sending data, note that it
may take up to 5 minutes for the data to start being accepted if your pricing
plan supports only one domain.

Note that subdomains are treated as domains, meaning that foo.example.com and 
bar.example.com are counted as two domains.

### What are the user satisfaction scores shown in Experience based on?

The scores are based on the time threshold defined in the [Configure
Requirements](/docs/experience/configure-requirements) screen. By default these time
thresholds are 2 seconds. You can adjust these time thresholds if you have a
different performance target for your website or webapp. You can read
[Configure Requirements](/docs/experience/configure-requirements) to learn how to
adjust the time thresholds or [User
Satisfaction](/docs/experience/user-satisfaction) to learn more about Apdex scores
in general.

### Can I see a single visitor's full session?

Yes, with a few caveats:

 * Ensure your Experience App doesn't have [sampling](/docs/experience/faq/#when-should-i-use-sampling) enabled
 * Ensure you select the appropriate views/month to accomodate all your monthly page views and [avoid staggering](/docs/experience/faq/#can-i-receive-more-data-than-my-monthly-plan-limit-allows).  You can see your daily page views and change the views/month for each Experience App under App Settings.
 * See also [Why are some page loads not shown in Experience?](/docs/experience/faq/#why-are-some-page-loads-not-shown-in-experience)

### How are memory measurements performed?

Memory measurements requested by the [Browser SDK](/docs/agents/browser/) are requested 
with every page load. In addition to that, the measurements are taken periodically 
so that you can see the memory usage over time.

### How can I exclude a specified URL(s)?

An array of URLs to exclude, can be specified in the global variable `STRUM_IGNORE_AJAX`:
```
<script type="text/javascript">
  // Array of domains to exclude
  window.STRUM_IGNORE_AJAX = ['https://domain1.com', 'https://domain2.com'];
</script>
``` 

## Troubleshooting

### I am not seeing data in my Experience App. What should I do?

The Sematext Experience Script sends data via HTTP(S) requests directly from the 
visitors browsers to Sematext's servers for processing and storage.
If you've configured a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) 
in your application, make sure that the Domain `rum-receiver.sematext.com` (or 
`rum-receiver.eu.receiver.com` if you are using Sematext EU) is allowed for outgoing
requests (as described in this section, the client-side bundle will report Analytics 
via network requests).

### My App has stopped receiving data. What should I do?

Check if you have reached your daily limit in the App settings -> Usage screen. If
you have reached your daily limit, you can increase the daily limit or disable
<a href="#what-is-staggering">staggering</a> but note that this may cause <a
href="#what-is-overage">overage</a> and additional costs at the end of the
month.

If your limits are not reached, check if the Experience script is configured
according to the installation instructions.

If the script is configured correctly, and your daily limits are not reached
please contact us via live chat or <support@sematext.com>.

### Why are some page loads not shown in Experience?

There are multiple factors that affect if a page load will be recorded in Experience or not:

 * Some page loads will not be recorded if data sampling is turned on
 * We skip data collection when metrics are not reliable such as when the browser tab is refreshed
 * We pause most data collection when the browser tab is in the background
 * Certain ad blockers might prevent the Browser SDK script from loading or block network requests for data collection

### Why am I not seeing page loads, but I'm seeing memory usage measurements? 

After the initial page load, the memory measurements will be taken periodically in 
scheduled intervals. If your users leave the application open in the browser for a 
longer time period the measurements will be taken and sent to Sematext Cloud 
constantly. Your selected time range may include memory measurements, but the page 
load may be outside of it.
