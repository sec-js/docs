description: How to limit the amount of data in Experience Apps using data sampling

If you are using the Pro Experience plan and have a website with very high traffic then you can use the data sampling functionality to limit the amount of data that will be saved in the App.

This can significantly reduce the costs and allow you to use a plan with a lower monthly page views limit. Of course this is a tradeoff between the loss of precision and cost reduction.

To configure sampling for your App:

 * open App Settings and switch to the Usage tab
 * adjust the sampling rate as required
 * click "Save Changes"
