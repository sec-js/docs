title: Audit Trail
description: Track user activities and changes across your account to see who did what, when, and whereâ€”making it easier to monitor usage and maintain compliance.

Audit Trail helps you track changes made by users across your account. It shows what was changed, who made the change, and when. This includes actions like creating, updating, or deleting Alerts, Apps, Pipelines, and other important resources.
This feature is useful for reviewing changes over time, identifying who changed what and when, troubleshooting issues by checking recent updates, and improving visibility and accountability across your team.
