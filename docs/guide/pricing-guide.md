## Apps and Plans

For each of the four solutions, you can create multiple [Apps](https://sematext.com/docs/guide/app-guide/). Apps act as containers for your data. Every App is isolated and standalone, each App can have a different plan and other attributes that affect cost. This allows you to customize costs for each App individually and control the overall spend. For each App you can change the following:


- [Logs](https://sematext.com/pricing/#logs) Apps: 
  - Plan
  - Daily log volume
  - Data retention
- [Monitoring](https://sematext.com/pricing/#infrastructure) Apps: 
  - Plan
  - Number of hosts and containers
  - Data retention 
- [Experience](https://sematext.com/pricing/#experience) Apps: 
  - Plan
  - Page views
  - Data retention
- [Synthetics](https://sematext.com/pricing/#synthetics) Apps: 
  - Plan
  - Number of [Browser](https://sematext.com/docs/synthetics/browser-monitor/) and [HTTP](https://sematext.com/docs/synthetics/http-monitor/) monitors
  - Data retention
  
This flexibility ensures you only pay for what you use. For example, you might create multiple Apps and choose a minimal retention plan for test hosts and a higher retention plan for production hosts.

All App attributes, like plan, data retention, etc. can be changed up or down at any time without contacting Sematext. All changes take effect right away.

Refer to our [cost calculator](https://sematext.com/cost-calculator/) to estimate costs for each solution based on your needs. The calculator sums up the total based on your selections and shows your estimated monthly charge. You can also explore detailed plans on the [pricing page](https://sematext.com/pricing/).

Custom plans and pricing is available. Contact our [Customer Success Manager](https://meetings.hubspot.com/sean-monahan?uuid=4265218b-524a-4ca7-8ec7-2ba4ea120a0f) to discuss anything Sematext related and for custom plans.

All of our plans include support via live chat and email. For Standard and Pro Plans, we also provide phone support and a dedicated account manager for any questions about Sematext, such as pricing, best practices, and demos.

## Payment Methods

- Credit Card - charged at the first of the month for the previous month’s usage
- Monthly Invoices
- Prepayment - We invoice you and, once we receive your payment, we add this amount as credit towards your Sematext account balance. Every month, we subtract from this balance according to your previous month's usage. We notify you before your balance gets too low, so that we can repeat the invoicing process before your credit runs out. This is also how the annual plan works: you prepay for 12 months and receive a 10% discount in return.
- If you are using multiple solutions and an annual prepayment, you will receive a 15% discount. To check your eligibility and inquire about other discounts, you can schedule a call with your account manager directly from the Settings screen.

## Team Management and Billing Policies

- You can invite as many team members as you want at no additional cost.
- If you use Sematext as a team or company, we recommend creating an account that is not tied to any individual's email and converting it to a [team account](https://sematext.com/docs/team/#team-account). There are no additional costs for using a team account. Others can then be invited to and removed from that account and be assigned roles.
- Users can have [different roles such as user, admin, and billing admin](https://sematext.com/docs/team/).
  - Account owners and billing admins can add or remove credit cards and have full control over the Apps within the account.
- You can set a billing email within the Settings screen. This email, along with the account owner's and billing admin’s emails, will receive invoices.
- We charge credit cards on the 1st of the month. If the charge fails, we will send you an email about the failure and will keep trying until the 15th. If we cannot charge by the 15th, and a free plan is available, we will downgrade the Apps to the free plan. If a free plan is not available, we will disable your Apps. As soon as you enter a valid payment method, you can enable your Apps without losing any data. If your App was downgraded to a free plan with limited features and data retention, your older data will get deleted according to the free plan’s features and data limits.
- If you are on an annual payment plan, we will email the account owner, billing admins, and the billing email when the prepaid balance is low and it's time to top-up.

## Cost Estimation

### App-Level Cost Estimation

To see the details of your estimated cost for a specific App, go to the App, click on App Settings from the left menu panel. 

![Sematext Cloud App Settings - Cost Estimations](../images/guide/pricing/app-settings-cost-estimations.png) 

- **Last month**: Amount charged for the App for the previous month.
- **Month to date**: Costs for your App made in the current month so far.
- **Full month estimate**: Estimate for future months based on the current usage and plan. For the purpose of this calculation, the trial period is ignored.
- **Current month estimate**: Sum of costs for the current month so far and estimate for the rest of the month based on current usage and plan. This estimate takes into account any trial period but you won’t be charged for the usage during the trial period.

### Account-Level Cost Estimation

For a general overview of your estimated monthly costs across all Apps, visit the Settings → Plans & Billing screen. There, you can see a detailed breakdown of costs by each App in the data table at the bottom of the screen.

![Plans & Billing](../images/guide/pricing/plans-billing.png) 

### Trial Period

We offer a 14-day trial period with all Pro features enabled. During this period, you won't be charged. Estimated costs for trial Apps will show as $0 in the Plans & Billing section. However, if you're curious about post-trial costs, you can toggle on the Show Estimations for Trial Apps button.

## Billing Flexibility

### No Commitment

Unless you choose to switch to an annual payment plan, which you can do at any time, there is no commitment and no contract with Sematext. When/if you want to stop using Sematext you simply stop sending us your metrics and/or switch to the Free plan. You can also upgrade/downgrade your plans at any given time, as well as change the data retention, number of hosts, volume of logs, etc. Usage is metered hourly, so any changes made will take effect immediately.

Our goal is to provide a flexible and transparent pricing model, ensuring there are no surprises at the end of the month by offering customizable plans and clear cost estimations. If you have any questions or need further assistance, reach out to us at support@sematext.com.
