title: Scheduled Reports Guide 
description: Sematext Scheduled Reports let you receive emails with dashboards or reports embedded in them at a specified frequency.

## What are Scheduled Reports

Scheduled Reports let you receive emails with [dashboards](/docs/dashboards/) or [reports](/docs/dashboards/reports-and-components/) embedded in them at a specified frequency (one time, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.). They can include information on system performance, application logs, and more. The reports are delivered via email, providing a convenient and automated way for teams to stay informed about their applications and infrastructure health and performance.

## What you can do with Scheduled Reports

With Scheduled Reports you can:

1. Monitor your application's performance: Automatically receive reports on key metrics such as response time, errors, and traffic, allowing you to quickly identify and resolve any performance issues.
2. Analyze logs: Get automated reports on logs generated by your application, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot errors and issues.
3. Share information: Share the reports with stakeholders, team members, or customers, keeping everyone informed on the health and performance of the application without having them log into Sematext Cloud.
4. Save time: Automated report delivery saves time and eliminates manual reporting processes. Moreover, the reports are embedded into emails, so one doesn't have to download and view reports with any external viewers.
5. Customize reports: Customize reports to meet your specific needs, including selecting the metrics and logs to include, defining the frequency and the date range of reports, and choosing the delivery method.
6. Spot slower changes happening over an extended period of time: For example, configuring a Scheduled Report to show data for the last 7 or 30 days, you can identify trends and changes in behavior over a longer period of time that might not be immediately apparent from checking real-time metrics or alerts that are triggered by looking at very recent, real-time data. This can help you detect issues early on, before they become critical, and take proactive steps needed to address them, for example decisions about tuning, scaling,and capacity planning.

Overall, Scheduled Reports provide a convenient and efficient way to stay informed on the performance of your application, making it easier to identify and resolve any issues.

The generated Report will look like the one below. In this example you can spot the disk usage that is slowly creeping up and that may not trigger alerts for low available disk space until later.  By seeing this trend in Scheduled Reports you can take action early, such as adding capacity, or troubleshooting the root cause.

That's it! With Scheduled Reports, you can have the performance and log information you need, when you need it, without having to manually generate reports.
