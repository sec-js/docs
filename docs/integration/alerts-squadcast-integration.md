**5.** In **Services** click the **Alert Sources** under the service you would like to integrate Sematext notifications with. If you wish to receive notifications from Sematext to different services you will need to create multiple notification hooks:

**6.** In the opened window type **Sematext** and copy the **Sematext Webhook URL**:

Having the **Alert Source** configured and having the **Sematext Webhook URL** we can add the notification hook to Sematext. 

## In Sematext

**1.** Navigate to [Notification Hooks](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/hooks/create) (in [EU](https://apps.eu.sematext.com/ui/hooks/create)) and select Squadcast card to create a new Squadcast notification hook.

Next, click the **Send Test Notification** button. Squadcast should return information similar to **{"data":{"message":"Pipeline processing done"},"meta":{"request_id":"8a8c2d9b-aea6-479b-9f1f-373ac6785d37"}}** indicating everything is configured correctly. Check your Squadcast integration for the test message from Sematext. 

Once the test message is visible, click the **Save Notification Hook** button to save your configuration.
