Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine designed for scalability and high-performance search functionalities across varied data types and sources. The [Sematext Agent](/docs/agents/sematext-agent/) collects Elasticsearch metrics and logs, transmits them to Sematext Cloud; installing the agent takes less than 5 minutes.

## Install Sematext Agent

1. Create an Elasticsearch Logs or Monitoring [App](/docs/guide/app-guide/). This will let you install the agent and control access to your monitoring and logs data.
2. Install the Sematext Agent according to the [https://apps.sematext.com/ui/howto/Elasticsearch/overview](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/howto/Elasticsearch/overview) displayed in the UI.
3. After installing the agent, the Discovery tab shows all the Elasticsearch services identified on the host and you will start receiving metrics or logs from Elasticsearch services.
4. Make sure that HTTP metrics are enabled by setting `http.enabled: true` in `elasticsearch.yaml`. Also set the `node.name` value in the same file. Elasticsearch will otherwise generate a random node name each time an instance starts, making tracking node stats over time impossible. The `elasticsearch.yml` file can be found in `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` or `$ES_HOME/config/elasticsearch.yml`.
5. If you've created an Elasticsearch Monitoring App and want to collect Elasticsearch logs as well, or vice versa, click on the **Create Logs App** button from the left menu panel. This will navigate you to the 'Create Logs App' (or Monitoring App) page, where you'll find all the discovered log sources from Elasticsearch services and manage log and metric shipping effortlessly.

Having both Elasticsearch Logs and Monitoring Apps lets you correlate performance metrics and logs, and accelerate troubleshooting using [Split Screen](/docs/guide/split-screen/) for faster resolution. For example, correlating metrics (such as CPU, memory usage, disk I/O) with logs (search queries, indexing operations), you can identify if a sudden spike in resource usage aligns with a specific type of query or indexing operation. This correlation helps in optimizing queries, indexing strategies, or scaling resources to maintain optimal performance. Or if you see logs of a node restarting, metrics let you see the impact on the rest of the cluster in terms of CPU, GC, and other metrics. Including query time metrics, even if you don't collect slowlogs from [all] queries.

To [explore logs and services](/docs/monitoring/autodiscovery/) across multiple hosts, navigate to [Fleet & Discovery > Discovery > Services](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/fleet-and-discovery/discovery/services) (or  [Sematext Cloud Europe](https://apps.eu.sematext.com/ui/fleet-and-discovery/discovery/services)). From there, you can create additional [Apps](/docs/guide/app-guide/) or stream data to existing ones without requiring any additional installations. 

## Important Metrics to Watch and Alert on

### System and JVM Metrics

The first place we would recommend looking for in a new system are the OS metrics: CPU, memory, IO and network. A healthy CPU graph looks like this:

![CPU usage](https://sematext.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-26-at-11.18.14-1.png)

Note how the relative percentage of *wait* and *system* is negligible compared to *user*. Meaning we don't have a bottleneck in IO. And total usage isn't close to 100% all the time, so there's headroom.

If there's high CPU usage, have a look at JVM garbage collection (GC) times. Which are probably good candidates for alerts. If GC times are high, then Elasticsearch is in trouble with JVM memory, rather than doing useful work with the CPU. You can look deeper into JVM memory usage to check. A healthy pattern looks like a shard tooth:

![JVM memory usage per pool](https://sematext.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-26-at-10.50.27-1.png)

When it comes to system memory, don't be worried if you see very little free, like here:

![System memory usage](https://sematext.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-26-at-11.24.02-1.png)

The operating system will try to cache your index files as much as it can. The *cached* memory can be freed up, if the system needs more memory.

### Elasticsearch-specific metrics

You'll want to monitor query rates and times. In other words, how fast is Elasticsearch responding? Since this will likely impact your users, these are metrics worth alerting on as well.

![Query and fetch rate](https://sematext.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-26-at-11.09.09-1.png)

On the indexing side, check the indexing rate:
![Indexing rate](https://sematext.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-26-at-11.13.19-1.png)

And correlate it with the asynchronous refresh and merge times, as they can correlate with your CPU spikes:

![Refresh, flush and merge stats](https://sematext.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-26-at-11.16.51-1.png)

For example, if refresh time is too high, you might want to adjust the [refresh interval](https://sematext.com/blog/elasticsearch-refresh-interval-vs-indexing-performance/).

Last, but certainly not least, you may want to get an alert if a node leaves the cluster, so you can replace it. Once you do, you can keep an eye on shard stats, to see how many are initializing or relocating:

## Elasticsearch Default Alerts

As soon as you create an Elasticsearch App, you will receive a set of default [alert rules](/docs/guide/alerts-guide/). These pre-configured rules will [notify](/docs/alerts/alert-notifications/) you of important events that may require your attention, as shown below.

### Node count anomaly

This alert rule continuously monitors the count of nodes in an Elasticsearch cluster, checking for anomalies in the number of nodes present within the cluster. When anomalies are detected, it triggers a warning (WARN priority). The minimum delay between consecutive alerts triggered by this alert rule is set to 10 minutes.

Suppose an Elasticsearch cluster typically maintains a stable number of nodes, but due to various factors such as node failures, scaling activities, or network issues, the node count experiences sudden changes. When this happens, the alert rule checks for anomalies in the count of nodes over the last 90 minutes. Upon detecting the anomaly, the alert rule triggers a warning.

#### Actions to take

- Check the status of nodes within the Elasticsearch cluster for any nodes that may be offline, unavailable, or experiencing issues
- Check the logs of the node that went down and/or logs of the master node
- If node failures are detected, you may need to restart failed nodes or replace hardware
- If the node count changes due to scaling activities (e.g., adding or removing nodes), review the recent scaling events to confirm that they are intentional and expected
- Monitor network connectivity between nodes within the Elasticsearch cluster for any network issues that may be affecting communication and node discovery


### Java old gen usage > 97%

This alert rule continuously monitors the usage of Java's old generation heap memory in an Elasticsearch environment, triggering a warning if the usage exceeds 97%. Note that this shouldn't happen in a healthy environment. It's likely that the node will either face an out of memory exception or run into the Parent Circuit Breaker. Either way, you'd have unexpected failures. The minimum delay between consecutive alerts triggered by this alert rule is set to 10 minutes.

Suppose the Java old generation heap memory usage in the Elasticsearch environment starts increasing and eventually exceeds 97% over a 5-minute period.

#### Actions to take

- [Review and optimize the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) configuration](https://sematext.com/blog/jvm-metrics/), including heap size settings, garbage collection algorithms, and memory management parameters
- Investigate recent application changes, updates, or deployments that may have contributed to the spike in memory usage

### Field data size

This alert rule continuously monitors the field data size in an Elasticsearch cluster and triggers a warning if the field data size exceeds a certain threshold (20 in this case). The minimum delay between consecutive alerts triggered by this alert rule is set to 10 minutes.

Significant field data usage points to a misconfiguration. Normally, you'd only use field data for global ordinals. If you're using >20%, you probably do sorting/aggregations on a text field with field data enabled. Which is dangerous (you may run out of heap on an expensive query). So you'd want to pre-process the data in the pipeline before Elasticsearch and do your sorting/aggregations on doc_values instead.

#### Actions to take

- Check _cat/fielddata, it will tell you which fields use more field data
- Consider scaling up the resources allocated to the Elasticsearch cluster, such as increasing the JVM heap size, to accommodate the increased field data size

### Tripped parent circuit breaker

This alert rule continuously monitors the tripping of the parent circuit breaker in an Elasticsearch cluster, detecting instances where the circuit breaker has been triggered usually due to very high memory usage (for real memory, current default is 95% of JVM heap). When such instances are detected, it triggers a warning (WARN priority). The minimum delay between consecutive alerts triggered by this alert rule is set to 10 minutes.

Suppose an Elasticsearch cluster experiences a sudden increase in query load or indexing throughput, leading to very high memory usage and triggering the parent circuit breaker. When this happens, the alert rule checks for instances of the parent circuit breaker being tripped over the last 5 minutes. The alert is triggered as soon as the circuit breaker is tripped at least once within the specified timeframe.

#### Actions to take

- Analyze resource usage metrics for the Elasticsearch cluster, including CPU, memory, and disk utilization, to find the source of the increased load
- Review and optimize search queries or indexing operations that may be contributing to the increased load on the cluster. Consider optimizing query performance, reducing indexing throughput
- Consider scaling up the resources allocated to the Elasticsearch cluster, such as increasing the JVM heap size and number of nodes

### Unassigned shards anomaly

This alert rule continuously monitors the presence of [unassigned shards](https://sematext.com/blog/elasticsearch-unassigned-shards/) in an Elasticsearch cluster, detecting anomalies in the number of unassigned shards over time. When anomalies are detected, it triggers a warning (WARN priority). The minimum delay between consecutive alerts triggered by this alert rule is set to 10 minutes.

Suppose an Elasticsearch cluster typically maintains a low number of unassigned shards, but due to issues such as node failures or disk space constraints, the number of unassigned shards suddenly increases. When this happens, the alert rule checks for anomalies in the number of unassigned shards over the last 30 minutes. Upon detecting the anomaly, the alert rule triggers a warning.

#### Actions to take

- Check the status of Elasticsearch nodes to determine if any nodes are experiencing issues or are offline
- Review disk space on Elasticsearch nodes to see if there is sufficient space available for shard allocation
- Review shard allocation settings in the Elasticsearch cluster configuration to make sure that shards are allocated properly and evenly across nodes
- Recover [unassigned shards](https://sematext.com/blog/elasticsearch-unassigned-shards/) and allocate them to available nodes in the cluster

### Thread pool rejections anomaly

This alert rule continuously monitors thread pool rejections in an Elasticsearch environment, detecting anomalies in the rate at which thread pool requests are rejected. When anomalies are detected, it triggers a warning (WARN priority). The minimum delay between consecutive alerts triggered by this alert rule is set to 10 minutes.

Suppose an Elasticsearch cluster experiences a sudden increase in thread pool rejections, potentially due to resource limitations or high query loads. When this happens, the alert rule checks for anomalies in thread pool rejections over the last 90 minutes. Upon detecting the anomaly, the alert rule triggers a warning.

#### Actions to take

- Review system metrics for the Elasticsearch cluster, including CPU, memory, and disk usage, for any resource constraints that may be contributing to thread pool rejections
- Analyze query patterns for any inefficient or resource-intensive queries. Optimize queries to reduce the load on the cluster (only applies for the search thread pool)
- Check the calling applications and use fewer threads to talk to Elasticsearch

### Used memory > 80%

This alert rule continuously monitors memory usage in an Elasticsearch environment and triggers a warning (WARN priority) when the used memory exceeds 80% of the total available memory. The minimum delay between consecutive alerts triggered by this alert rule is set to 10 minutes.

If the heap size is set too high in the Elasticsearch configuration, it might lead to excessive memory usage. In such cases, when the heap memory usage goes over 80% of the total available memory, the alert rule checks memory usage over the last hour. Upon crossing the threshold, the alert rule triggers a warning.

#### Actions to take

- Review and optimize the configuration settings of the Elasticsearch cluster, including heap size allocation

### Swap usage

This alert rule continuously monitors swap usage in an Elasticsearch environment by tracking the rate of swap input/output operations. When any amount of swap usage is detected, it triggers a warning (WARN priority). This includes even the slightest swap activity, such as reading or writing a single byte to or from swap space.

The minimum delay between consecutive alerts triggered by this alert rule is set to 10 minutes.

Suppose there is some activity detected in the swap usage on a node in the Elasticsearch cluster. Despite the relatively small amount of swap activity, the alert rule triggers a warning to prevent any big (and potentially unacceptable) slowdowns in Elasticsearch caused by accessing swap memory.

#### Action to take

- Turn off swap usage

### Open files > 85%

This alert rule continuously monitors the percentage of open files in an Elasticsearch cluster. When the percentage exceeds 85% within the specified timeframe, it triggers a warning (WARN priority). The minimum delay between consecutive alerts triggered by this alert rule is set to 10 minutes.

Suppose an Elasticsearch cluster typically operates with a healthy percentage of open files, but due to increased usage or resource limitations, the percentage of open files exceeds 85%. When this happens, the alert rule checks for instances where the percentage of open files exceeds 85% within the last 10 minutes and triggers a warning.

#### Actions to take

- Verify and adjust open file limits for Elasticsearch processes. The default open file limit for most systems is 65,536
- If the open file limit is approaching the recommended threshold, check unusual merge policies or a large number of very small shards
- A high percentage of open files usually signals a misconfiguration. Review Elasticsearch cluster configuration settings and consider optimizing resource allocation and file management settings to better handle file usage and prevent excessive file opening

### Load average

This alert rule continuously monitors the load average of an Elasticsearch cluster and triggers a warning when the load average exceeds a specified threshold (currently when load average is more than 2). The minimum delay between consecutive alerts triggered by this alert rule is set to 10 minutes.

Suppose the average load on the Elasticsearch cluster typically remains below 2, but due to increased query loads or resource constraints, the load average spikes above 2. When this happens, the alert rule checks for load average values over the last 30 minutes. Upon detecting the load average anomaly, the alert rule triggers a warning.

#### Actions to take

- Review thread pools, indexing and search operations, heap usage, etc.
- Review and optimize queries or indexing processes that may be contributing to the increased load on the cluster
- If the increased load is due to resource limitations, consider scaling up resources such as CPU or memory

You can [create additional alerts](/docs/alerts) on any metric.

## Logs

Once data is in, you can explore it via the built-in reports: 

![Elasticsearch Logs Overview Report](/docs/images/agents/elasticsearch_logs_overview.png)

## Exploring logs

Once data is in, you can explore it using the built-in reports or create your own. For example, you can use the Queries report to see a breakdown of your queries and "zoom in" to the ones you're interested in:

![Elasticsearch Queries Report](/docs/images/agents/elasticsearch_logs_queries.png)

Other built-in reports include:

- **Errors**: breakdown of what's wrong: which nodes or components generate errors
- **Clustering**: logs produced by components that have to do with cluster coordination: master logs, logs related to a node joining/leaving a cluster and shard allocation
- **Deprecation**: breakdown of deprecation logs by node and coomponent
- **Start & Stop**: startup-related and shutdown-related logs. Look here if a node went down unexpectedly or doesn't show up in the cluster when started

### Alert Setup
There are 3 types of alerts in Sematext:

 - **Heartbeat alerts**, which notify you when a Elasticsearch DB server is down
 - Classic **threshold-based alerts** that notify you when a metric value crosses a predefined threshold
 - Alerts based on statistical **anomaly detection** that notify you when metric values suddenly change and deviate from the baseline

Let’s see how to actually create some alert rules for Elasticsearch metrics in the animation below. The request query count chart shows a spike. We normally have up to 100 requests, but we see it can jump to over 600 requests. To create an alert rule on a metric we’d go to the pulldown in the top right corner of a chart and choose “Create alert”. The alert rule applies the filters from the current view and you can choose various notification options such as email or configured [notification hooks](/docs/alerts/#alert-integrations) (PagerDuty, Slack, VictorOps, BigPanda, OpsGenie, Pusher, generic webhooks etc.)

## Troubleshooting

If you have trouble sending logs, try out the latest version of [Sematext Agent](/docs/agents/sematext-agent/installation/). Also, make sure Sematext Agent is configured to send logs to your Elasticsearch Logs App. Last, check the [Log Agents panel](/docs/fleet/#log-agents) for any errors, and refer to our [Sematext Logs FAQ](/docs/logs/faq/) for useful tips.

### FAQ

** Why doesn't the number of documents I see in Sematext match the number of documents in my Elasticsearch index **

Sematext collects index stats from primary shards only.  To see the
total number of documents in an index, select all shards in that index
and choose "sum".  The list of shards and the "sum" function can be
found in the "Shard filter" in the Index Stats
report.

** Can Sematext Agent collect metrics even when Elasticsearch HTTP API is disabled **

Each Sematext Agent collects Elasticsearch metrics only from the local
node by accessing the Stats API via HTTP.  To allow only local access
add the following to elasticsearch.yml. Don't forget to restart each ES
node to whose elasticsearch.yml you add this.

``` bash
http.host: "127.0.0.1"
```

** Can I point Sematext Agent to a non-localhost Elasticsearch node **

Yes.  Adjust
/opt/spm/spm-monitor/conf/spm-monitor-config-*TOKEN\_HERE*-default.properties
and change the SPM\_MONITOR\_ES\_NODE\_HOSTPORT property from the
default localhost:9200 value to use an alternative hostname:port.  After
that restart Sematext Agent (if you are running a standalone App Agent version) or
Elasticsearch process(es) with embedded App Agent.

** My Elasticsearch is protected by basic HTTP authentication, can I use Sematext Agent  **

Yes. You just need to adjust
/opt/spm/spm-monitor/conf/spm-monitor-config-*TOKEN\_HERE*-default.properties
file by adding the following two properties (replace values with your
real username and password):

``` properties
ST_MONITOR_ES_NODE_BASICAUTH_USERNAME=yourUsername
ST_MONITOR_ES_NODE_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD=yourPassword
```

Restart your Sematext Agent after this change (either with **sudo service
spm-monitor restart** in case of standalone App Agent or by restarting
Elasticsearch node if you are using in-process
App Agent).

** I am using Sematext Agent and I don't see Index (and/or Refresh/Flush/Merge) stats, why is that **

Sematext Agent collects Index stats only from
primary shards, so it is possible that you installed Sematext Agent on some
Elasticsearch node which hosts only replicas. The same is also true for
Refresh/Flush and Merge stats. Also note that Sematext Agent
should be installed on all your Elasticsearch nodes to get the complete
picture of your cluster in Sematext Reports UI.
