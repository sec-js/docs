title: Elasticsearch Monitoring Integration
description: Collect and monitor key Elasticsearch metrics such as request latency, indexing rate, and segment merges with built-in anomaly detection, threshold, and heartbeat alerts. Send notifications to email and various chatops messaging services, correlate events & logs, filter metrics by server, node, time or index, and visualize your cluster's health with out of the box graphs and custom dashboards

The detailed explanation of Elasticsearch Monitoring and Logs integration can be found on the [Elasticsearch integration](/docs/integration/elasticsearch-integration/) page, where you can set up the shipping of both metrics and logs through a single installation.
