## CI/CD Monitors
CI/CD Monitors are designed for continuous, pre-release testing of your APIs, web applications, user journeys, etc. as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
These monitors can be automatically triggered at specific points within your CI/CD pipelines â€” whenever code is pushed, pull requests are opened 
or before they are merged into master, before or after new versions of applications are deployed, etc. 
This supports shift-left testing, enabling earlier detection of issues and minimizing the risk of production regressions and incidents.
