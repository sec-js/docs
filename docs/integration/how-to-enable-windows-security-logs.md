title: How to Enable Windows Security Logs
description: Important Windows Security Logs to keep track of.

By default, some critical security events are not tracked by Windows Servers. To improve security monitoring, you need to manually enable logging for these events. Below is a list of the top 10 security events and steps to enable them.

## File Audit

Keeps track of who accessed or changed important files.

**How to enable auditing for specific files or folders:**

1. **Enable Object Access Auditing:** (Allows Windows to start tracking access to any files or folders you specify later.)

   - Open **Group Policy Editor** (type `gpedit.msc` in the Start menu).
   - Go to: `Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Object Access > Audit File System`.
   - Set both **Success** and **Failure** to track all actions.

2. **Set Auditing on a Specific File or Folder:**

   - Right-click on the file or folder you want to audit and select **Properties**.
   - Go to the **Security** tab and click **Advanced**.
   - In the Advanced Security Settings window, go to the **Auditing** tab.
   - Click **Add**, then select **Principal**. In the box that appears, type **Everyone**, and click **OK**.
   - Under **Type**, select **Success** (to track successful access) and **Failure** (to track failed access attempts).
   - Under **Basic Permissions**, select the activities you want to audit (e.g., **Read, Write, Delete**).
   - Click **OK** to apply the settings, and close the windows.

## Process Creation

## Audit Policy Changes

Tracks any changes to logging settings, which might signal tampering attempts.

**How to enable:**
