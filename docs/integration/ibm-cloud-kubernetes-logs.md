title: IBM Cloud Kubernetes Logs Integration
description: Sematext IBM Cloud Kubernetes Logs integration is configured by running Logagent as a DaemonSet in your cluster.

With this integration you can:

- Forward all Containerd container logs
- Use log globs to choose which container log files to tail
- Drop noisy logs with `dropEvents`
- Forward logs to different Apps
- Enable Kubernetes audit logs 

IBM Cloud Kubernetes uses Cointainerd as the container engine. In this case Logagent can't use the Docker remote API to retrieve logs and metadata. Instead, logs are collected from Containerd log files, which requires access to the relevant directories.

The Logagent [input-filter for Containerd](/docs/logagent/input-filter-containerd/) supports:

* Tailing log files from `/var/log/containers/`, `/var/log/pods` and `/var/data/kubeletlogs`
* Enrichment of logs with podName, namespace, containerName, containerId
* Joining long log events over 4KB into one log event
* Parsing Containerd log headers (timestamp, stream, flags)
* Parsing message content with Logagent's parser library


## Default Setup of IBM Cloud Kubernetes Logs

With the default setup you edit env vars to change the configuration.

### Forward all Container Logs

Run Logagent as [Kubernetes DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset).

First, create the [ibm-cloud-logagent-ds.yml](https://github.com/sematext/logagent-js/blob/master/kubernetes/ibm-cloud-logagent-ds.yml) DaemonSet file.

```bash
curl -o ibm-cloud-logagent-ds.yml  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sematext/logagent-js/master/kubernetes/ibm-cloud-logagent-ds.yml
```

Set your `LOGS_TOKEN` in the `spec.env` section in the `ibm-cloud-logagent-ds.yml` file.

Then run the DaemonSet:

```
kubectl create -f ibm-cloud-logagent-ds.yml
```

### Use `LOG_GLOB` to Filter Which Container Logs to Forward

Log globs make it easy to use wildcards to filter in/out which log files to tail.
In the `spec.env.LOG_GLOB` env var you can set values not to include logs from certain containers.
To read more about log globs, [check this out](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob).

Here's how you can exclude all logs from the `kube-system` namespace:
```yaml
env:
  - name: LOG_GLOB
    value: "/var/log/containers/!(*kube-system*.log);/var/log/*.log"
```

Or, only include logs from the `default` namespace:
```yaml
env:
  - name: LOG_GLOB
    value: "/var/log/containers/*default*.log;/var/log/*.log"
```

This is a quick way of including/excluding logs from containers.

## Advanced Setup of IBM Cloud Kubernetes Logs

With the advanced setup you add a `logagent.conf` file as a `ConfigMap` to change the configuration.
With this config file you have more control over the settings, including:

- dropping logs
- log routing
- more fine tuned filtering
- ability to add audit logs

### 1. Create a `logagent.conf` file

The `logagent.conf` is the main config file for Logagent.

```yaml
# logagent.conf
options:
  debug: false

input: 
  files: 
    - /var/log/*.log
    - /var/log/containers/*.log

inputFilter:
  - module: input-filter-k8s-containerd

outputFilter:
  kubernetesEnrichment:
    module: kubernetes-enrichment

output:
  elasticsearch:
    module: elasticsearch
    url: https://logsene-receiver.sematext.com # for US
    # url: https://logsene-receiver.eu.sematext.com # for EU
    index: YOUR_SEMATEXT_LOGS_TOKEN
```

This particular config above will work the same as using the default setup with env vars.
You may need to adjust the `url` to the Sematext region you are using.

### 2. Add the `logagent.conf` as a `ConfigMap`

Create the `ConfigMap` from the `logagent.conf` file. Run this command from the dir where you have the `logagent.conf`:

```bash
kubectl create configmap logagent-config --from-file=./logagent.conf
```

### 3. Create the Logagent DaemonSet

Create the [ibm-cloud-logagent-with-config-ds.yml](https://github.com/sematext/logagent-js/blob/master/kubernetes/ibm-cloud-logagent-with-config-ds.yml) DaemonSet file.

```bash
curl -o ibm-cloud-logagent-with-config-ds.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sematext/logagent-js/master/kubernetes/ibm-cloud-logagent-with-config-ds.yml 
```

You don't need to change anything as all the config is in `logagent.conf`, just run the DaemonSet:

```bash
kubectl create -f ibm-cloud-logagent-with-config-ds.yml
```

**When you want to edit the config, change the `logagent.conf`, recreate the `ConfigMap`, restart the Logagent `Pod` to grab the new `ConfigMap` and you're done!**

Continue reading below to see how to configure more advanced settings.

### Drop Noisy Container Logs 

Edit the `logagent.conf` to add the [drop-events](/docs/logagent/output-filter-dropevents/) outputFilter.

```yaml hl_lines="14 15 16 17 18 19"
# logagent.conf
options:
  debug: false

input: 
  files: 
    - /var/log/*.log
    - /var/log/containers/*.log

inputFilter:
  - module: input-filter-k8s-containerd

outputFilter:
  dropEvents:
    module: drop-events
    filters:
      message:
        include: !!js/regexp /critical|auth|error|failed/
        exclude: !!js/regexp /status/i
  kubernetesEnrichment:
    module: kubernetes-enrichment

output:
  elasticsearch:
    module: elasticsearch
    url: https://logsene-receiver.sematext.com
    index: YOUR_SEMATEXT_LOGS_TOKEN

```

In the `filters` section you can pick a field to apply regex matching to.
If there's a match you can either include or exclude that particular log line.
The example above will include all log lines that match `critical|auth|error|failed` but exclude all that match `status`.

### Forward Container Logs to Multiple Apps with Log Routing

To enable log routing you edit the output plugin to use multiple indices.
Under the token value you need to add a regex for the log file you want to match.

```yaml hl_lines="26 27 28 29 30"
# logagent.conf
options:
  debug: true

input: 
  files: 
    - /var/log/*.log
    - /var/log/containers/*.log

inputFilter:
  - module: input-filter-k8s-containerd

outputFilter:
  dropEventsFilter:
    module: drop-events
    filters:
      message:
        exclude: !!js/regexp /status/i
  kubernetesEnrichment:
    module: kubernetes-enrichment

output:
  elasticsearch:
    module: elasticsearch
    url: https://logsene-receiver.sematext.com
    indices: 
      b0e9f481-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-3ff20227d3d3: # All logs except kube-system
        - ^(?!.*(kube-system).*).*\.log
      9365eb2f-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-5a833072353f: # Only kube-system logs
        - .*kube-system.*\.log

```

In place of `b0e9f481-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-3ff20227d3d3` and `9365eb2f-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-5a833072353f` in the example above you would use your own Sematext Apps logs tokens.

### Enable Kubernetes Audit Logs

Create a Kubernetes Audit Logs App and a Generic Logs App.

![](https://sematext.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/apps.sematext.com_ui_logs-create-2.png)

Forwarding Kubernetes audit logs is similar to log routing. The prerequisite is to [follow steps 1-9 in the official IBM docs here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-health#webhook_logdna).

This will provision an audit webhook that will forward logs to a log file. With Logagent you can tail this file and forward logs to a Kubernetes Audit Logs App in Sematext.

In your `logagent.conf`, under the `indices` section, where you specify the token value for your Kubernetes Audit Logs App, you need to add a regex for the name of the audit webhook you created in the steps above. The name of this `Pod` is `ibm-kube-audit`.

```yaml hl_lines="28 30"
# logagent.conf
options:
  debug: true

input: 
  files: 
    - /var/log/*.log
    - /var/log/containers/!(st-logagent*.log) # exclude Logagent's own logs

inputFilter:
  - module: input-filter-k8s-containerd

outputFilter:
  dropEventsFilter:
    module: drop-events
    filters:
      message:
        exclude: !!js/regexp /status/i
  kubernetesEnrichment:
    module: kubernetes-enrichment

output:
  elasticsearch:
    module: elasticsearch
    url: https://logsene-receiver.sematext.com
    indices: 
      b0e9f481-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-3ff20227d3d3: # generic logs app
        - ^(?!.*(ibm-kube-audit).*).*\.log
      9365eb2f-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-5a833072353f: # kubernetes audit logs app
        - .*ibm-kube-audit.*\.log
```

This config will route all audit logs to your Kubernetes Audit Logs App and the other logs to your other Generic Logs App.

_Note: Here's how you find the token after you create a Kubernetes Audit Logs App._
