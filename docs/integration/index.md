title: Integrations
descriptions: Sematext integrations with ready to use monitoring agents and log shippers for infrastructure and container monitoring, log management and analytics, alerting, chatops, and more. Our Cloud and on-premises platform exposes the Elasticsearch API and syslog receivers with built in anomaly detection, data analysis and visualization tools and services

Sematext supports over **100 different integrations** that automatically collect thousands of metrics and logs from your systems and applications. These integrations simplify monitoring and logging processes, offering fine-tuned **pre-built reports and alert rules** that are readily available and require no additional configuration.

Many integrations can be enabled through [Service Autodiscovery](https://sematext.com/docs/fleet/discovery/), allowing you to start monitoring without modifying or restarting any services. This capability improves user experience by reducing setup time and facilitating easier integration.

The integrations are categorized to help you easily find solutions that suit your needs.
