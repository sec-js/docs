title: MySQL Logs Integration
description: With our new MySQL Logs Integration you get insight into your whole MySQL account. View general logs, connect and disconnect events as well as SQL statement events from clients.

The detailed explanation of MySQL Monitoring and Logs integration can be found on the [MySQL integration](/docs/integration/mysql-integration/) page, where you can set up the shipping of both metrics and logs through a single installation.
