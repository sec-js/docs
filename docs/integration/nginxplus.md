title: NginxPlus Monitoring Integration
description: The Sematext monitoring agent can collect many metrics from NginxPlus instances, including requests, reading, writing, waiting, active and more. Utilize built-in anomaly detection, threshold, and heartbeat alerting and send notifications to email and various chatops messaging services. Correlate events & logs, filter metrics by server or time, and visualize your cluster's health with out of the box graphs and custom dashboards

The detailed explanation of Nginx Monitoring and Logs integration can be found on the [Nginx integration](/docs/integration/nginx-integration/) page, where you can set up the shipping of both metrics and logs through a single installation.
