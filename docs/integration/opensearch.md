title: OpenSearch Monitoring Integration
description: Collect and monitor key OpenSearch metrics such as Cluster States and Pending Tasks, memory tied to shards, search latency, request rate, request cache, query/filter cache with built-in anomaly detection, threshold, and heartbeat alerts. Send notifications to email and various chatops messaging services, correlate events & logs, filter metrics by server, node, time or index, and visualize your cluster's health with out of the box graphs and custom dashboards

The detailed explanation of OpenSearch Monitoring and Logs integration can be found on the [OpenSearch integration](/docs/integration/opensearch-integration/) page, where you can set up the shipping of both metrics and logs through a single installation.
