title: Solr / SolrCloud
description: Comprehensive monitoring and logging integration for Solr and SolrCloud, providing robust capabilities to monitor and manage critical issues across your Solr infrastructure. Leverage predefined key metric reports and advanced data visualization tools to oversee Solr performance, including memory usage, uptime, load averages, index stats, document and filter caches, latency, query distribution, errors analysis, Zookeeper and Overseer logs, and more. Receive timely alerts to address potential concerns and optimize the efficiency of your Solr and SolrCloud environments.

Solr is an open-source search platform used for building and managing powerful search and data retrieval capabilities in applications. The [Sematext Agent](https://sematext.com/docs/agents/sematext-agent/) collects Solr metrics and logs, transmits them to Sematext Cloud; installing the agent takes less than 5 minutes and require no changes in Solr source code or your application source code.

## Install Sematext Agent

This lightweight, open-source [Monitoring Agent](https://github.com/sematext/sematext-agent-java) collects Solr performance metrics and sends them to Sematext. It comes packaged with a Golang-based agent responsible for Operating System level metrics like network, disk I/O, and more. The Solr Monitoring Agent can be installed with RPM/DEB package manager on any host running Linux or in a containerized environment using ```sematext/sematext-agent```.

The Sematext Solr Monitoring Agent can be run in two different modes - *in-process* and *standalone*. The *in-process* one is run as a Java agent, it is simpler to initially set up, but will require restarting your Solr node when you will want to upgrade your monitoring Agent, i.e. to get new features. The benefit of the *standalone* agent mode is that it runs as a separate process and doesn't require a Solr restart when it is installed or upgraded.

1. Create an Solr Logs or Monitoring [App](https://sematext.com/docs/guide/app-guide/). This will let you install the agent and control access to your monitoring and logs data.
2. Install the Sematext Agent on each host running your Solr/SolrCloud nodes to have the full visibility over the metrics from each host. The full installation instructions can be found in the [setup instructions](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/howto/SolrCloud/overview) displayed in the UI.

The last step to install Sematext Agent is by running a command like this:

```bash
sudo bash /opt/spm/bin/setup-sematext  \
    --monitoring-token <your-monitoring-token-goes-here>   \
    --app-type solrcloud  \
    --agent-type javaagent  \
    --infra-token <your-infra-token-goes-here>
```

The command above will set up your SolrCloud Monitoring Agent in the *in-process* mode. To have it running in the *standalone* mode, run the command below instead of the one above:

```bash
sudo bash /opt/spm/bin/setup-sematext  \
    --monitoring-token <your-monitoring-token-goes-here>   \
    --app-type solr  \
    --agent-type standalone  \
    --infra-token <your-infra-token-goes-here>  \
    --jmx-params '-Dspm.remote.jmx.url=localhost:3000'
```

Keep in mind that your need to provide the Monitoring token and Infra token. They are both provided in the [installation instructions](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/howto/SolrCloud/overview) for your SolrCloud App.
  
3. Adjust the ```solr.in.sh``` file and add the following section:
   
```bash
SOLR_OPTS="$SOLR_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote
-javaagent:/opt/spm/spm-monitor/lib/spm-monitor-generic.jar=<your-monitoring-token-goes-here>::default"
```

Or if you would like to run the Solr Monitoring Agent in the *standalone* mode add the following section to the ```solr.in.sh``` file:
```bash
SOLR_OPTS="$SOLR_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3000 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false"
```
Make sure that tag ```<jmx />``` is enabled in your ```solrconfig.xml``` file.

**You need to restart your Solr node after the changes above.**

4. After installing the agent, the Discovery tab shows all the Solr services identified on the host and you will start receiving metrics or logs from Solr services.
5. If you've created an Solr Monitoring App and want to collect Solr logs as well, or vice versa, click on the **Create Logs App** button from the left menu panel. This will navigate you to the 'Create Logs App' (or Monitoring App) page, where you'll find all the discovered log sources from Solr services and manage log and metric shipping effortlessly.

Having both Solr Logs and Monitoring Apps lets you correlate performance metrics and logs, and accelerate troubleshooting using [Split Screen](https://sematext.com/docs/guide/split-screen/) for faster resolution. For example, your metrics might indicate a sudden spike in query latency or a rise in memory consumption. By correlating this with the logs, you might discover that during this period of high latency, there were specific queries generating errors or that certain indexing tasks were failing due to insufficient resources.

To [explore logs and services](https://sematext.com/docs/monitoring/autodiscovery/) across multiple hosts, navigate to [Fleet & Discovery > Discovery > Services](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/fleet-and-discovery/discovery/services) (or  [Sematext Cloud Europe](https://apps.eu.sematext.com/ui/fleet-and-discovery/discovery/services)). From there, you can create additional [Apps](https://sematext.com/docs/guide/app-guide/) or stream data to existing ones without requiring any additional installations.

## Solr Default Alerts

As soon as you create an Elasticsearch App, you will receive a set of default [alert rules](https://sematext.com/docs/guide/alerts-guide/). These pre-configured rules will [notify](https://sematext.com/docs/alerts/alert-notifications/) you of important events that may require your attention, as shown below.

### Warmup time > 5m

This alert rule continuously monitors the warmup time of a Solr cache, identifying instances where the warmup time exceeds 5 minutes. When such instances are detected, it triggers a warning (WARN priority). The minimum delay between consecutive alerts triggered by this alert rule is set to 10 minutes.

Suppose a Solr cache is configured to warm up before serving requests, and the typical warmup time is around 3 minutes. However, due to increased data volume or inefficient warmup processes, the warmup time suddenly increases to 7 minutes. When this happens, the alert rule checks for warmup time anomalies over the last 5 minutes. Upon detecting the warmup time anomaly, the alert rule triggers a warning.

#### Actions to take

- Review the warmup process of the Solr cache for any bottlenecks or configuration issues contributing to the extended warmup time
- Optimize the warmup process by 
    - Adjusting the autoWarmCount parameter for relevant caches
    - Verifying the frequency of soft commits (either autoSoftCommit or from the application) to check if they happening too often
    - Optimizing queries used during warmup or adjusting cache configuration settings to reduce warmup time. This may involve tuning the newSearcher queries

You can [create additional alerts](https://sematext.com/docs/alerts) on any metric.

## Logs

Once data is in, you can explore it via the built-in reports: 

![Solr Logs Overview](../images/agents/solr_logs_overview.png)

Be sure to check out the [Solr Monitoring integration](./solr.md) as well, to get a complete view on Solr. For example, if you see logs of a node restarting, metrics let you see the impact on the rest of the cluster in terms of CPU, GC, and other metrics. Including query time metrics, even if you don't collect logs from [all] queries.

## Exploring logs

Once data is in, you can explore it using the built-in reports or create your own. For example, you can use the Queries report to see a breakdown of your queries and "zoom in" to the ones you're interested in:

![Solr Queries Report](../images/agents/solr_logs_hits.png)

Other built-in reports include:

- **Errors**: breakdown of what's wrong: which nodes/classes/collections/etc generate errors
- **Zookeeper**: logs produced by Solr's [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org) client and other Zookeeper-related classes and threads. Look here for insights on SolrCloud's stability. For the Zookeeper ensemble itself, check out our [Zookeeper monitoring integration](./zookeeper.md)
- **Overseer**: logs produced by SolrCloud's [Overseer](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/8_6_0/solr-core/org/apache/solr/cloud/Overseer.html) thread and other Overseer activities (e.g. shard leader election)
- **Start & Stop**: startup-related and shutdown-related logs. Look here if a node went down unexpectedly or doesn't show up in the cluster when started

## Correlating Metrics & Logs

You can also correlate logs with metrics using [Split Screen](../guide/split-screen.md). For example, if you have a slow query in the logs, you can bring your Solr Monitoring App on the same screen and dig deeper in four steps:

![](https://sematext.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/solr-performance-01.png)

1. Click the Split Screen button to bring a new App to your screen.
2. Select your Solr Monitoring App.
3. Select the report/dashboard you're interested in, such as the CPU and Memory report.
4. Hover the mouse over the latency spike and you'll see the vertical bar showing the same time on all charts from both sides of your screen.

A full example of Solr metrics and logs correlation can be found in [this article](https://sematext.com/blog/solr-slow-queries/).

## FAQ

** How do I enable JMX in Solr? **

Add or uncomment the **<jmx/\>** directive in ```solrconfig.xml``` and
restart Solr.  See <https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrJmx> for more
info.

** I don't see any data on Solr and JVM reports, what is the problem? **

You should probably enable JMX in your Solr. Add or uncomment
the **<jmx /\>** directive in ```solrconfig.xml``` and restart Solr.
 See <https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrJmx> for more info.

** I don't see any data only in Solr Components or Errors reports, what should I do? **

Most likely you are using the standalone variant of App Agent. In
that case, App Agent can't collect metrics which are available only
when running in-process. If so, switch to in-process (javaagent) version
of App Agent.

** Why don't I see Solr index file size metric? **

App Agent runs as 'spmmon' user.  Make sure this user has appropriate access permissions on Solr's index directories.  If you cannot give 'spmmon' user the read permissions you can switch to the in-process (javaagent) version of the App Agent.
