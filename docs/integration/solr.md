title: Solr Monitoring Integration
description:  Our monitoring and logging platform includes integration for Solr. Use predefined key metrics reports combined with rich data visualization tools to monitor critical Solr issues, and receive alerts on memory usage, uptime, load averages, index stats, document and filter caches, latency, rate, and more

The detailed explanation of Solr Monitoring and Logs integration can be found on the [Solr integration](/docs/integration/solr-integration/) page, where you can set up the shipping of both metrics and logs through a single installation.
