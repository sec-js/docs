title: Varnish Cache Logs Integration
description: Sematext Varnish Cache Logs integration allows you to check response time, first byte served, along with traffic distribution across servers and requests made to the client and backend side.

The detailed explanation of Varnish Cache Monitoring and Logs integration can be found on the [Varnish Cache integration](/docs/integration/varnishcache-integration/) page, where you can set up the shipping of both metrics and logs through a single installation.
