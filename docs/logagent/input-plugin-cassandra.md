title: Logagent input plugin for Apache Cassandra
description: Logagent features modular logging architecture framework where each input or output module is implemented as a plugin. Use Cassandra queries as input and stream the output into Logagent. Export data from Cassandra , run queries frequently, choose time zone and format for query time, use multiple CQL query statements features, index CQL data to Elasticsearch/Opensearch and create analytics and monitoring graph event as well as alerts based on series in database

## Input Plugin: Apache Cassandra
