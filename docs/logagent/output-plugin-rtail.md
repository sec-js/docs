 rtail:
    # rtail host to send logs to
    host: localhost
    # rtails port to send logs to 
    udpPort: 3434
    # start rtail-server with given http port and bind to hostname
    webPort: 8080
    webHost: localhost
```

logagent --config rtail.yaml
```

logagent -e http://localhost:9200 -i mylogs --rtailHost myrtailserver --rtailPort 9999 /var/log/*.log
```

```
# logagent has no dependency to rtail, to keep the package small
logagent -s -e http://localhost:9200 -i mylogs --rtailWebPort 8080 --rtailPort 9999 /var/log/*.log
```
