title: Set up logs discovery
description: Getting started with logs discovery

To set up logs discovery simply deploy the Sematext Agent in your infrastructure. Head to the [installation](/docs/agents/sematext-agent/installation) instructions to proceed with the deployment. You'll have to deploy the Sematext Agent on every host where you would wish to discover and manage log files and container logs.

Once you have successfully deployed the agent, navigate to the `Fleet & Discovery > Discovery > Logs` screen where you can explore all of your discovered log sources.
