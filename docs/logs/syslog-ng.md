title: Sematext Syslog-ng Integration
description: Ship your logs to Sematext centralized monitoring and logging plafrom with syslog-ng. Configure sources to collect all system messages and tail files, tag logs, configure destination with Token and IP-based authentication, and bind sources to destinations


## Overview

syslog-ng is a modern syslog daemon that's focused on flexibility and
portability. It also has an easy to use configuration format that helps
you ship your logs to a Logs App in 3 steps:

1.  **sources**. syslog-ng can listen to local [syslog traffic](https://syslog-ng.com/documents/html/syslog-ng-ose-latest-guides/en/syslog-ng-ose-guide-admin/html/configuring-source-system.html),
    can [tail files](https://syslog-ng.com/documents/html/syslog-ng-ose-latest-guides/en/syslog-ng-ose-guide-admin/html/reference-source-file.html) and
    more
2.  **destinations**. You can send your logs to Logs Management App via UDP, TCP or
    [RFC-5425 TLS Syslog](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5425)
3.  **bind sources to destinations**. Once you have your sources and
    destinations defined, you have to define paths by linking sources
    and destinations with the [log statement](https://syslog-ng.com/documents/html/syslog-ng-ose-latest-guides/en/syslog-ng-ose-guide-admin/html/logpath.html)

## Configure Sources

Sources enable syslog-ng collect the logs you want to send to Logs Management App.
You can use system() to collect all the local syslog messages from that
system. You can put this at the beginning of your
**/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf**, along with your configuration
version. We recommend running version 3.19 or later:

``` bash
@version:3.19
source local_logs {
    internal();
    system();
};
```

To download a more recent version of syslog-ng than the one on your
system, take a look at the [download page of syslog-ng](https://syslog-ng.com/3rd-party-binaries).

### Tailing Files

syslog-ng can also listen to other inputs, such as
[files](https://syslog-ng.com/documents/html/syslog-ng-ose-latest-guides/en/syslog-ng-ose-guide-admin/html/reference-source-file.html),
[TCP or UDP](https://syslog-ng.com/documents/html/syslog-ng-ose-latest-guides/en/syslog-ng-ose-guide-admin/html/reference-source-tcpudp.html).

To tail a file, you'll use the file() source and point it to the right
file. If that file doesn't contain syslog-formatted messages, you'll
need to tell syslog-ng not to try and parse it, and if you need
multi-line support, you should specify that,
too:

``` bash
source jetty_log { file("/var/log/jetty" flags(no-parse) multi-line-mode(indented)); };
```

## Configure Destinations

There are two options to properly configure your destination:

- with your Logs Management application token (which is what we recommend)
- or by authorizing your public IPs from the Logs Management App UI.

After you choose your authentication method, you'll configure your
destination according to the protocol you prefer: UDP, TCP or TLS. For
all cases, your endpoint will be
**logsene-syslog-receiver.sematext.com** / **logsene-syslog-receiver.eu.sematext.com** (if using Sematext Cloud Europe)

### Token Authentication

To enable token authentication, get the token of your Logs Management
application from the [list of Logs Maangement applications](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/logs).
Then, put it in the template() statement of your Logs Management App destination.
See working examples below. The end result is a [CEE-formatted JSON syslog](/docs/logs/json-messages-over-syslog)
message that contains your token in the **logsene-app-token** field.

IMPORTANT: For JSON formatting that enables token authentication to work
you'll need syslog-ng version 3.3 or later and the **libjson** syslog-ng
plugin. The libjson plugin is typically provided by the
**syslog-ng-json** package of your distribution.

### IP-based Authentication

The alternate method for authentication is by pre-authorizing your
public IP in Logs Management App's UI. [Here is a complete guide](/docs/logs/authorizing-ips-for-syslog) on how to do that. If
you choose this path, you don't need the template() statement from the
code snippets below.

### UDP

To send logs over the fire-and-forget UDP protocol, your can add a
destination like the one below to **/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf**. If
you're using token-based authentication, you'll have to fill in your
Logs Management application token. If you've authorized your public IP, the
template() statement should be removed:

``` bash
template sematext { 
    template("<${PRI}>1 ${ISODATE} ${HOST} ${PROGRAM} ${PID} - - $(format-json --pair message=\"$MSG\" --pair logsene-app-token=\"LOGSENE_APP_TOKEN_GOES_HERE\")\n");
};

destination sematext {
    udp("logsene-syslog-receiver.sematext.com"
        port(514)
# template() statement should be removed if you authorized your IP
        template(sematext)
    );
};
```

### TCP

For TCP, the destination will look similar to the one for UDP, the only
change is in the protocol() statement. Make sure your real token is
there or remove the template() statement if you've authorized your IP:

``` bash
template sematext { 
    template("<${PRI}>1 ${ISODATE} ${HOST} ${PROGRAM} ${PID} - - $(format-json --pair message=\"$MSG\" --pair logsene-app-token=\"LOGSENE_APP_TOKEN_GOES_HERE\")\n");
};

destination sematext {
    tcp("logsene-syslog-receiver.sematext.com"
        port(514)
# template() statement should be removed if you authorized your IP
        template(sematext)
    );
};
```

### TLS

For configuring [RFC-5425 TLS Syslog](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5425),
you'll configure the destination in a similar fashion to plain TCP,
except for adding tls() statement and pointing it to your certificates
directory and **changing the port to 10514**:

``` bash
template sematext { 
    template("<${PRI}>1 ${ISODATE} ${HOST} ${PROGRAM} ${PID} - - $(format-json --pair message=\"$MSG\" --pair logsene-app-token=\"LOGSENE_APP_TOKEN_GOES_HERE\")\n");
};

destination sematext {
    tcp("logsene-syslog-receiver.sematext.com"
        port(10514)
        tls(
            ca_dir("/etc/ssl/certs")
            peer_verify("required_trusted")
        )
# template() statement should be removed if you authorized your IP
        template(sematext)
    );
};
```

## Bind Sources to Destinations

After configuring your source and destination the last step is binding
the two:

``` bash
log {
    source(local_logs); destination(sematext);
};
```

If you're tailing files or you defined other sources, you need to bind
them to the **logsene** destination in order to have those messages
shipped to your Logs Management application as well. For example:

``` bash
log {
    source(jetty_log); destination(sematext);
};
```

 

Then, restart syslog-ng and you should see your logs in the [Logs Management App UI](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/logs).

## Logs Tagging

From your syslog messages, Logs Management App will populate a number of [special fields](/docs/logs/special-fields), such as the **source** and
**host**. You can also configure syslog-ng to add a tag to logs matching
certain criteria. This is useful when you want to quickly identify a
special kind of logs. For example, you could tag events that come to the
"kern" facility with a severity/level of "err" as "kernel errors".

To achieve this, you can define a
[filter](https://syslog-ng.com/documents/html/syslog-ng-ose-latest-guides/en/syslog-ng-ose-guide-admin/html/configuring-filters.html)
that matches such events. Then, you'd define a destination similar to
the ones [described above](syslog-ng/#configure-destinations),
where you'd add a **tags** field. Finally, you'd define a **log**
statement where you bind your source, the newly defined filter and the
newly defined destination:

``` bash
filter user_tests { facility(kern) and level(err) };

template sematext { 
    template("<${PRI}>1 ${ISODATE} ${HOST} ${PROGRAM} ${PID} - - $(format-json --pair message=\"$MSG\" --pair logsene-app-token=\"LOGSENE_APP_TOKEN_GOES_HERE\")\n");
};

destination sematext {
    tcp("logsene-syslog-receiver.sematext.com"
      port(514)
      template(sematext)
    );
};

log { source(all_syslog); filter(user_tests); destination(sematext); flags(final); };
# main Logsene "log" statement will be defined below
```

 

Notice the **final** flag to this log statement - this prevents
syslog-ng from sending matched events twice (once with tags and once
without). Make sure you place the log statement with tags before your
main log statement.
