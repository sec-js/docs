## Side Navigation

The persistent region on the left that can be collapsed, is used to easily switch across monitoring, log management, real user monitoring, and other user & team features. All side navigation tabs are selectable. If they have chevrons, it indicates that the top level section is collapsible and contains additional subitems. The subitems will let you explore all your Apps, or choose a particular App.

## Report Settings

Once you [create a Monitoring App](/docs/monitoring/quick-start/#creating-a-monitoring-app), and start your Agent, it will have a set of default [reports and components](/docs/monitoring/reports-and-components/). You can edit, clone and delete these reports or create new ones. You can also define [report variables](/docs/dashboards/report-variables/) to dynamically fiter and group data in a report.

Based on what type of Monitoring Integration you chose, more reports get created by default. In this OpenSearch integration you can see three more reports are created by default.
