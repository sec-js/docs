title: Using the Synthetics API for fetching and creating monitors
description: How to use the Synthetics API for fetching and creating monitors.

In addition to scheduled monitor runs, you can also trigger monitor runs by using an API. You can use this API to trigger monitor runs as part of your [CI/CD pipeline](/docs/synthetics/ci-cd/overview) and block deployments if runs fail. When a run fails, you'll be alerted via your configured alert [notification hooks](/docs/alerts/alert-notifications). The run monitor API can be used to:

* Test the APIs, websites, and the user journeys in your PR and staging environments and annotate the pull requests with the results. 
* Test the APIs, websites, and the user journeys in production immediately after deployment and alert when it fails.
* Track and catch major changes in website metrics like page load time, page size, request count, 3rd Party API performance, etc introduced as part of code changes.

Together with scheduled monitor runs, the API can also be used in the creation of HTTP and Browser monitors, both with and without a [User Journey script](/docs/synthetics/user-journey-scripts/overview). The create monitor API can be used to add multiple monitors in bulk using a script. The create monitor API can be used to:

* Create single HTTP and Browser monitors, with and without a User Journey script. 
* Create multiple HTTP and Browser monitors at once.

## Run Monitor API

The run monitor API can be triggered by sending an HTTP request with the below configuration:

**US Region Endpoint**

* `https://apps.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/v3/apps/<appId>/monitors/runs`

**EU Region Endpoint**

* `https://apps.eu.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/v3/apps/<appId>/monitors/runs`

**HTTP Method** - `POST`

**Request Headers** - `Authorization: apiKey <apiKey>`

**Request Body**
```json
[
    {
        "monitorId": <monitorId-1>,
        "locations": [<locationId-1>, <locationId-2>,...],
    },
    {
        "monitorId": <monitorId-2>,
        "locations": [<locationId-1>, <locationId-2>,...],
    },
    ...
]
```

### Getting the apiKey
Your account's  `<apiKey>` can be copied from the **Settings** -> **API** page, which can be found:

- [here](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/account/api), if your account is registered in the US region, or
- [here](https://apps.eu.sematext.com/ui/account/api), for the EU region

### Getting the appId
* The `<appId>` and `<monitorId>` values can be extracted from the URL of the **Monitor Overview** page. For example, if the **Monitor Overview** page URL is `https://apps.sematext.com/ui/synthetics/12345/monitors/276` then the `appId` is `12345` and `monitorId` is `276`.

### Getting the locationId
* `<locationId>` - List of locations to run the monitor from. If not specified, the monitor will be run from all locations specified in the monitor configuration. The supported locations are:

| Location ID  | Location |
|---|---|
| us-east-1      | N. Virginia, USA   |
| eu-west-1      | Ireland            |
| ap-south-1     | Mumbai, India      |
| ap-southeast-1 | Singapore          |
| ap-southeast-2 | Sydney, Australia  |
| eu-central-1   | Frankfurt, Germany |
| sa-east-1      | SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil  |
| us-west-1      | N. California, USA |


**Example Request**

The below API triggers runs for monitors with ID `276` and `335` belonging to App with ID `12345` from locations `N.Virginia, USA`, `Mumbai, India` and `N.Virginia, USA`, `Ireland, Europe` respectively.

```sh
curl --request POST \
  --url https://apps.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/v3/apps/12345/monitors/runs \
  --header 'Authorization: apiKey 1d7a2d6b-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-10f83c5c8da7' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
    {
        "monitorId": 276,
        "regions": ["us-east-1","ap-south-1"]
    },
    {
        "monitorId": 335,
        "regions": ["us-east-1","eu-west-1"]
    }
]'
```

### Customize Request Configuration

There are cases where you might want to customize request parameters depending on the environment. For example, the deployment URL for running the monitor in a PR environment or a different HTTP header for the staging environment. You can pass these custom configurations as part of run monitor API data. When the custom values are passed the configured values for scheduled runs will be overridden with the custom values.

For [HTTP monitors](/docs/synthetics/http-monitor), the following fields can be customized:

* **URL**
* **Request Headers**
* **Request Cookies**
* **Request Params**
* **Request Body**

Below is an example where we are override the HTTP configuration parameters:

```sh
curl --request POST \
  --url https://apps.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/v3/apps/12345/monitors/runs \
  --header 'Authorization: apiKey 1d7a2d6b-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-10f83c5c8da7' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
    {
        "monitorId": 276,
        "url": "https://pr-2589.app.acme.com",
        "headers": [
            {
                "name": "Authorization",
                "value": "pr-env-key"
            }
        ]
    }
]'
```

For [Browser monitors](/docs/synthetics/browser-monitor), the URL of the website can be customized.

For Browser monitors with a script, you can pass custom parameters as variables, that could be referenced in the script.
<!-- TODO: Expand this and explain how it's done -->

### Customize Output Format

By default the API output will be in JSON format. While invoking the API in build pipelines, it might be useful to display the output in a table format, so that the output could be easily interpreted. To get the output in table format, set the `Accept` header to `text/plain`. The API response contains the summary of the request and lists the individual run results with the link to the run result page. Below is an example request along with the output:

```sh
curl -s --request POST --url https://apps.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/v3/apps/12345/monitors/runs --header 'authorization: apiKey 1d7e2d6b-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-10f83c5a8da7' --header 'accept: text/plain'        --header 'content-type: application/json' --data '[{"monitorId": 276}]' 
All monitors passed successfully.

## Monitor Overview API

The monitor overview API can be invoked by sending an HTTP request with the below configuration:

| Region | Endpoint
| --- | --- |
| US | `https://apps.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/apps/<appId>/monitors` |
| EU | `https://apps.eu.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/apps/<appId>/monitors` |

**HTTP Method** - `GET`

**Request Headers** - `Authorization: apiKey <apiKey>`

### Getting the apiKey
* Your account's `<apiKey>` can be copied from the **Settings** -> **API** page.

### Getting the appId
The `<appId>` can be obtained by sending a GET request using the above request header and `<apiKey>` to the required endpoint:

| Region | Endpoint
| --- | --- |
| US | `https://apps.sematext.com/users-web/api/v3/apps` |
| EU | `https://apps.eu.sematext.com/users-web/api/v3/apps` |

Example:
```
curl -L -X GET 'https://apps.sematext.com/users-web/api/v3/apps' \

**Request Headers** - `Authorization: apiKey <apiKey>`

### Getting the apiKey
* `<apiKey>` of your account can be copied from Settings -> API page.

### Getting the appId
* The `<appId>` and `<monitorId>` values can be extracted from the URL of the Monitor Overview page. For example, if the Monitor Overview page URL is `https://apps.sematext.com/ui/synthetics/12345/monitors/276` then the `appId` is `12345` and `monitorId` is `276`.
* The `<appId>` can also be obtained by sending a GET request using the above request header and `<apiKey>` to the required endpoint:

| Region | Endpoint
| --- | --- |
| US | `https://apps.sematext.com/users-web/api/v3/apps` |
| EU | `https://apps.eu.sematext.com/users-web/api/v3/apps` |

Example:
```
curl -L -X GET 'https://apps.sematext.com/users-web/api/v3/apps' \

### Create a Browser Monitor
When creating a Browser Monitor which uses a User Journey script, special characters in the User Journey script should be correctly escaped.
To create a Browser Monitor which monitors a URL using a User Journey script, we would send an HTTP request as follows:
```
curl -L -X POST 'https://apps.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/apps/17174/monitors/browser' \

## Get all Monitors for an App

To get all the available monitors for an App, the API can be triggered by sending an HTTP request with the below configuration:

| Region | Endpoint
| --- | --- |
| US | `https://apps.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/apps/<appId>/monitors` |
| EU | `https://apps.eu.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/apps/<appId>/monitors` |

**HTTP Method** - `GET`

**Request Headers** - `Authorization: apiKey <apiKey>`

Example:

In order to get all the available monitors for the App with an `<appId>` of `17174`, we would send an HTTP request as follows:
```
curl -L -X GET 'https://apps.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/apps/17174/monitors' \
-H 'Authorization: apiKey 9bddb0a6-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-397d15806cfd'
```
Result:
```
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": 3124,
    "name": "Example HTTP monitor",
```

In the above example we can see that the `<monitorId>` for the `Example HTTP monitor` is `3124`. Using the obtained `<monitorId>`, we can then perform an API request to retrieve only information on the `Example HTTP monitor`.

## Get a single Monitor for an App

To get information on a single monitor for an App, the API can be triggered by sending an HTTP request with the below configuration:

| Region | Endpoint
| --- | --- |
| US | `https://apps.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/apps/<appId>/monitors/<monitorId>` |
| EU | `https://apps.eu.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/apps/<appId>/monitors/<monitorId>` |

**HTTP Method** - `GET`

**Request Headers** - `Authorization: apiKey <apiKey>`

Example:

In order to get information on the monitor with a `<monitorId>` of `3124` for the App with `<appId>` equal to `17174`, we would send an HTTP request as follows:
```
curl -L -X GET 'https://apps.sematext.com/synthetics-api/api/apps/17174/monitors/3124' \
-H 'Authorization: apiKey 9bddb0a6-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-397d15806cfd'
```
Result:
```
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": 3124,
    "name": "Example HTTP monitor",
```
