title: Sematext Account Members
description: Inviting team members to your account means they get access to all your Apps, dashboards, notification hooks, alert rules, and everything else!  

By inviting a user to your Account, you invite them to your **whole account**, 
so they get access to **all** your [Apps](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/integrations/apps), 
[Dashboards](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/dashboards), [Notification Hooks](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/hooks), [Alert Rules](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/alerts/rules), and 
[Integrations](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/integrations).

To share your Account with other users, go to the 
[Team page](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/team/account-members) on Sematext Cloud.
