title: Enabling Transaction Tracing
description: Enable transaction tracing in monitoring agent configuration file and start tracing code execution from beginning to end, and identify performance bottlenecks in running code across applications, networks, and servers. 

To enable tracing edit the monitor configuration file -
/opt/spm/spm-monitor/conf/spm-monitor-config-${token}-${jvm}.properties:

``` properties
# enable tracing agent
SPM_MONITOR_TRACING_ENABLED=true
Â 
# capture only transaction that took longer than this many milliseconds
# default value is 50ms
# WARNING: setting this too low will increase the agent overhead
MIN_TRANSACTION_DURATION_RECORD_THRESHOLD=50
```
