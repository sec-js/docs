title: Supported Technologies
description: Sematext APM platform provides Java applications distributed tracing support for automatically tracing requests to web servers such as Tomcat and Jetty as well as techologies like Spring Boot, Elasticsearch TransportClient and more

Currently, only Java applications can be traced. The agent is compiled
with Java 1.6 target, so applications using Java 1.6 and up are
supported.

**Application servers:**

  - Apache Tomcat - 6.0.x, 7.0.x, 8.0.x
  - Jetty - 7.x, 8.x, 9.x
  - Generic servlet container (without cross-application tracing
    support)

**Technologies:**

  - Generic JDBC driver support
  - JPA
  - Spring
  - Elasticsearch TransportClient
  - java.net.URL
  - Apache HttpClient 3.x, 4.x
  - JAX-RS

Support for tracing your own JVM applications and other JVM-based
technologies can be added via [Custom Pointcuts](/docs/tracing/custom-pointcuts).
